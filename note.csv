Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 72-year-old male
with coronary artery disease status post myocardial
infarction, CHF with an ejection fraction of 15% and ICD for
DF/VT.  Here for possible ICD malfunction after he was
shocked three times at home the night before admission to an
outside hospital.  The first shock occurred on the morning
prior to admission with no preceding symptoms.  The second
shock occurred while walking downstairs, and he reported
reaching out his arm.  Third shock occurred shortly after
this when he was reaching out with his left hand, and the
final and fourth shock occurred when he was reaching out in
bed with his left arm and received multiple shocks in a row.

At the outside hospital, the patient had a magnet placed over
his ICD, and was given magnesium sulfate.  He was
hemodynamically stable, and had no complaints otherwise.

On review of symptoms, the patient reported occasional
orthostatic hypotension, but denied chest pain, shortness of
breath, nausea, or vomiting.  The patient denies fever or
chills.  Denied bloody stools or black stools.  The patient
denied orthopnea, PND, or dyspnea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
and ischemic cardiomyopathy.
2. ICD for VF with second SVC coil because of high DFTs with
three-lead fracture in 03/99.
3. Atrial fibrillation.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency.
5. CHF with an EF of 15%.
6. Hypercholesterolemia.
7. Obesity.
8. History of unsuccessful VT ablation.
9. Osteoarthritis.
10. BPH.
11. Reactive airway disease.
12. Diabetes mellitus type 2.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Toprol 50 b.i.d.
2. Vasotec 10 b.i.d.
3. Lasix 40 b.i.d.
4. Imdur 60 q.d.
5. Lanoxin 125 mcg.
6. Levoxyl 125 mcg.
7. Lipitor 40.
8. Plavix 75.
9. Spironolactone 25.
10. Dofetilide 250 q.d.
11. Coumadin 10 two days a week, 7.5 five days a week.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient reports coronary artery disease in
his father.  He also has a 50 pack year smoking history, but
quit 34 years ago.  He denies alcohol use.

ALLERGIES:  Shellfish and IV dye, which causes hives, and
amiodarone which caused edema.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.7, heart rate of
80, blood pressure 86/52, respiratory rate 16.  Saturating
97% on room air.  Patient was alert and oriented times three
in no acute distress.  Neck was supple.  Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light.  Clear oropharynx.  There was
no JVD and no carotid bruits.  Cardiovascular reveals
regular, rate, and rhythm with occasional irregular beats.
Faint systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal
border.  Respiratory:  Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities revealed trace bilateral lower extremity edema.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiac rhythm:  Patient is admitted with multiple shocks
from his ICD.  The shocks had occurred when the patient was
using his left arm predominantly.  This is likely due to the
fact that there was a device malfunction.  The device was
interrogated, and found to be oversensing noise from certain
arm movements.  The device was turned off and programmed DDD.
The INR was 2.5, so the patient was given vitamin K with plan
for future need revision.

Overnight the patient had a four-second pause on telemetry,
although the patient was asymptomatic.  The patient returned
to the Electrophysiology Laboratory and had a pacing catheter
placed.  The patient was transferred to the CCU on [**3079-3-4**] for further monitoring in the setting of transvenous
pacing.  The patient remained comfortable and when his INR
trended down, he returned to the EP Laboratory for device
revision and lead revision.  Patient tolerated the procedure
well.

After this, the patient returned to the [**Hospital3 **]
floors and received multiple shocks on the morning, which
were appropriate for ventricular tachycardia.  The patient's
pacemaker was interrogated and found to be functioning well.
It was reprogrammed to over pace out of ventricular
tachycardia prior to shocking.  The patient had additional
episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which were successfully
paced out of by his pacemaker.  Patient was started on
lidocaine drip given his significant ventricular tachycardia
and the episodes of VT diminished significantly.  The patient
was transitioned to mexiletine on the next day, and tolerated
this well.  The patient had no further episodes of
significant ventricular tachycardia.

2. Coronary artery disease:  The patient currently had no
symptoms.  He was continued on his Plavix, statin,
beta-blocker, and Imdur.  Patient was not admitted on an
aspirin, although he was given an aspirin during his
hospitalization given the fact that was Coumadin was held.
Plan for no aspirin on discharge with resuming his Coumadin
as per his prior home regimen.

3. Congestive heart failure:  Patient has an ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 20%.
An echocardiogram on this hospitalization again revealed an
ejection fraction of 15-20%.  While the patient was NPO
during episodes of this hospitalization, his Lasix and
aldactone was held; however, he was continued on his Lasix,
aldactone, digoxin, and ACE inhibitor.  Patient had no
evidence of congestive heart failure during this
hospitalization and he resumed his prior medications before
discharge.

4. Endocrine:  Patient with hypothyroidism:  The patient was
continued on his Levoxyl.  He was also maintained on a
regular insulin-sliding scale.  Blood sugars remained in
normal levels, and he did not require significant amounts of
insulin.

5. Renal:  Patient with chronic renal insufficiency.
Remained stable throughout this hospitalization.

6. Heme:  Patient's INR was reversed with vitamin K, and the
patient was instructed to resume Coumadin dosing on the
evening following discharge.  The patient will follow up with
his cardiologist or primary care physician for further
monitoring of his INR and adjustment of his Coumadin dose.

7. ID:  The patient had a temperature greater than 101.5
following his pacemaker placement, and therefore was
continued on his cephalosporin, which was originally given
for prophylaxis.  The patient was transitioned to p.o.
antibiotics, plan for seven-day course.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. ICD firing.
2. ICD revision.
3. Ventricular tachycardia.

adenopathy, full range of motion.  Cardiovascular:  Regular
rate and rhythm.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  2+ pulses, no edema.  On [**Last Name (un) 9261**] scope
the patient was found to have swelling at the base of the
tongue with marked edema of the false course and arytenoids,
about 4 mm airway, also with increased epiglottic size, no
ecchymosis.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 13.8 with 77%
neutrophils, hematocrit 31.5, platelet count 211,000, sodium
143, potassium 5.4, chloride 108, bicarbonate 20, BUN 46 and
creatinine 2.

TESTS:  CT scan of the neck showed supraglottitis with mild
to moderate narrowing of the supraglottic airway, associated
jugular lymphadenopathy with prominent lymphoid tissue at the
lung bases bilaterally.  Chest x-ray showed no acute
pulmonary edema, no acute cardiopulmonary process.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with a diagnosis
of supraglottitis.  He was given a dose of 10 mg of Decadron
in the Emergency Room and another 10 mg upon arrival to the
floor.  He was also started on clindamycin and levofloxacin
and given nothing by mouth.  He was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit for close observation and continuous pulse oximetry
monitoring.

The patient symptomatically improved.  On repeat scope, the
supraglottic swelling was decreasing and he was felt stable
to take oral intake on hospital day number two, which he
tolerated.  At the time of discharge, the patient is stable
with great improvement in his supraglottic swelling.  He is
tolerating orals and able to take a regular diet.  He will be
discharged home to complete a 14 days course of clindamycin
and is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2610**] in two to three
days.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
Supraglottitis.

Small amount of atherosclerotic plaque within the proximal left 
renal artery ( <50% narrowing).

pre-contrast sequences, suggest of chronic renal parenchymal 
disease. Clinical correlation is recommended.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
# Cardiac:  
a) pump/CHF: Pt came in with sig vol overload (JVD to angle jaw, 
3+ LE pitting edema). Pt was entered in the UNLOAD trial and was 
randomized to Ultrafiltration (UF). Over 2 days ~17 L of fluid 
was taken off, at 500 cc/hour. Lasix was held while on UF, and 
actos was d/c'd (can lead to retention of fluid). However, after 
2 days the pt's Cr [**Known patient firstname **] and UF was stopped. Afterwards, no 
further diuresis was attempted and the pt was fluid restricted 
while Cr recovered. On [**5-14**] restarted lasix at low doses 20 bid 
(previously had been 80 tid at home). 
Weights: [**5-4**] 129.6 on initiation  
.....[**5-5**] 118.9 am  
.....[**5-8**] 115.2  
.....[**5-11**] 116  
.....[**5-14**] 114.8 before discharge. 
.  
b) CAD- h/o CAD s/p CABG. Pt was continued on a Statin, beta 
blocker, and ASA was started.   
.  
c) Hypertension: On admission to the CCU pt's atenolol was 
changed to Toprol XL 50.  d/c'd hydralazine and Imdur, started 
norvasc 5 qd initially. Continued valsartan at 80 qday and 
clonidine patch was weaned off. As ultrafiltration removed a 
great deal of fluid, the pt's BP decreased significantly and as 
ARF ensued, her BP meds were taken off and ultrafiltration was 
stopped. By [**5-11**], she was having hypertension during the night 
so her toprol was increased to toprol 25mg bid for more 
even-action throughout the day. BP meds were added back on as 
kidney function improved and on [**5-14**] valsartan 40 was added back 
and lasix was restarted at low dose. Her BP remained high and so 
Isosorbide Dinitrate 20 mg TID was started as well as 
Hydralazine 50 mg TID. Lasix was titrated up to 40mg daily. 
These will be adjusted further as an outpatient.  
.  
d) Rhythm- Sinus. On tele.  
.  
# Renal failure: baseline Cr is 1.8-2.0. Creatinine [**Known patient firstname **] with 
ultrafiltration to as high as 4.0 on [**5-9**]. This was likely due 
to over-diuresis with the ultrafiltration leading to volume 
depletion and pre-renal renal failure.  Her antihypertensive 
regimen was also down-titrated as her BP droped with rapid 
volume correction. Urine lytes were consistent with ATN. Urine 
eosinophils were negative. MRA look for renal artery stenosis 
was positive for plaque but radiology did not feel this would be 
physiologically signficant. The pt's creatinine trended down to 
baseline with time and on discharge it was 2.1. She was 
restarted on the [**Last Name (un) 367**] and lasix which will be adjusted as an 
outpatient. 
.  
# Anemia: Hct dropped from 32.6 on admission to 27 after 
admission. Iron (iron 57, ferritin 122), B12 ok. epo level was 
high-normal. Thus, her anemia was felt to be likely anemia of 
chronic disease. On [**5-10**], she was transfused 1 u PRBC. Hct 
bumped to only 29.8. Stool was guiac negative. Subsequently, 
however, her Hct improved without further transfusion and on 
discharge Hct was 31.2. 
.  
# Endocrine: History of type II diabetes mellitus and 
hypothyroidism. Her admission TSH was 0.13 (on levothyroxine 
175) and HgbA1c 6.2. Levoxyl was decreased back to 150mcg. 
Actose was held and pt was maintained on Lantus and Humalog. 
.
# Depression: pt was felt to have a depressed affect and was 
started on Celexa in house. Her mood improved slightly near her 
discharge.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: 59-year-old male with end stage renal disease and on hemodialysis
     through a right internal jugular vein (IJ) tunneled catheter which showed poor
     flow in the last dialysis. Patient also had left arm arteriovenous graft
     placed in August which does not show thrill or pulsation.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1579**] [**Doctor Last Name **]
     d'Othee with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 7250**], the attending radiologist, being present in
     the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The risks, benefits were explained to the patient and
     informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the
     angiographic table and the right neck and the left arm were prepped and draped
     in sterile fashion. 1% Lidocaine was injected around the dialysis catheter
     exit site for local anesthesia.
     Contrast angiograms through both lumens of the catheter demonstrated extensive
     fibrin sheaths surrounding the catheter tip. Under fluoroscopic guidance,
     0.035 Amplatz wires were advanced through both lumens of the catheter
     respectively with the tip in the inferior vena cava. The catheter was removed.
     An 8 French [**Last Name (un) 534**]-Tip sheath was advanced over a wire with the tip in right
     lower internal jugular vein. Venogram by injection through the sidearm of the
     sheath again showed extensive filling defect in the right brachiocephalic vein
     and upper portion of the superior vena cava (SVC), consistent with fibrin
     sheath.
     Fibrin sheath venoplasty was performed with a 8 mm x 4 cm balloon first, and
     then a 14 mm x 4 cm balloon. Follow-up contrast venogram through the sheath
     demonstrated the flow tract in the right brachiocephalic vein and SVC is
     widely open, although, linear filling defects were still visualized but
     deviated to the right side of the vein.
     Subsequently a 14.5 French, double lumen, 24 cm-long (19 cn from cuff to tip)
     tunneled dialysis catheter was placed over the wire with the tip in the
     proximal right atrium. The catheter was flushed and locked with heparin
     solution. 0 Prolene stitches were used to secure the catheter to the skin.
                                                                 (Over)

     Examination of the left upper arm AV graft revealed no thrill or pulsation.
     Using ultrasound guidance, the graft was accessed with a 21 gauge needle close
     to the arterial anastomosis pointing to the venous outflow. An 0.018 wire was
     advanced through the needle into the graft. The needle was exchanged for a
     small introducer of the micropuncture set.
     Fistulogram with injection of nonionic contrast was performed and demonstrated
     occlusion at the venous anastomosis and absence of opacification of a good-
     caliber venous outlow.
     The graft itself is partially opacified and partially occupied with filling
     defects suggestive of thrombosis.
     There was also a large filling defect in the brachial artery just below the
     arterial anastomosis, that seems to extend up to just above the bifurcation of
     the brachial artery. The brachial artery distal to the anastomosis is still
     patent but with faint opacification.
     After discussion with the referring surgeon (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7847**]), the procedure was
     stopped at this stage. The catheter sheath was removed and local hemostasis
     was achieved by manual compression.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.

     access dialysis catheter treated with fibrin sheath venoplasty and replacement
     of the tunneled dialysis catheter.
     
     2. Occlusion of the left arm arteriovenous graft and venous anastomosis and
     partial obstruction of the brachial artery just downstream the arteriovenous
     anastomosis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old
gentleman with a significant cardiac history with coronary
artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft),
hypertension, congestive heart failure, hyperlipidemia, and
diabetes mellitus who presented with worsening congestive
heart failure of several months in duration with new onset
chest pressure.

The patient was in his usual state of health until three days
prior to admission when he began to experience increasing
shortness of breath at rest and with exertion. However, the
patient was still able to walk his dog for approximately one
half of a mile per day.  No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  No
orthopnea.  Minimal bilateral lower extremity edema at
baseline.

The patient had one episode of 5/10 chest pressure (his
anginal equivalent) with exertion three days prior to
admission which resolved after one hour.

On the day prior to admission, the patient had a second
episode of 10/10 chest pressure, substernal, and without
radiation.  No associated nausea, vomiting, or palpitations.
Mild diaphoresis and lightheadedness.  The patient took one
sublingual nitroglycerin, and his pain score went down to
7/10, and he presented to the [**Hospital1 47**] Emergency Department for evaluation.

In the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Department, the
patient's chest pressure was relieved with aspirin, heparin,
nitroglycerin, and Integrilin.  He also received metoprolol
intravenously.  He did continue to be short of breath despite
receiving 80 mg of Lasix intravenously on arrival.

The initial electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with a
left bundle-branch block and left atrial abnormality, without
any significant changed when compared to the previous tracing
of [**3264-2-16**].  His initial creatine kinase was 326
with a troponin T of 0.31.

Of note, the patient denies fevers or chills.  He has a
slight cough with sputum.  He is not on a low diet.  No
recent dietary indiscretion.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history was noncontributory for
coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired painter.  He has
been married times 44 years.  He has a 60-pack-year history
of tobacco; he quit 15 years ago.  Occasional alcohol use.
No intravenous drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed his temperature was 98.4 degrees
Fahrenheit, blood pressure was 133/64, his heart rate was
107, his respiratory rate went from 40 to 24, and his oxygen
saturation was 95% on 2 liters.  In general, an elderly
gentleman in no apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose,
and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.   Extraocular movements were intact.  The neck
was supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  No thyromegaly.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate.  Normal
first heart sounds and second heart sounds.  No murmurs,
rubs, clicks, or gallops.  Pulmonary examination revealed
decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.  No rales
or wheezes.  The abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Normal active bowel sounds.  No
hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Extremity examination revealed
2+ pitting edema bilaterally to the knees.  Neurologic
examination revealed alert and oriented times three.  Cranial
nerves II through XII were grossly intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Initial
laboratories revealed creatine kinase was 326, CK/MB was 14,
troponin T was 0.25, and MB index was 4.3.  His white blood
cell count was 7.8, his hematocrit was 33, and his platelets
were 281.  Sodium was 135, potassium was 4.2, chloride was
99, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was 24,
creatinine was 1.1, and blood glucose was 303.  Prothrombin
time was 13.8, partial thromboplastin time was 25.2, and his
INR was 1.3.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray demonstrated
cardiomegaly with pulmonary vasculature redistribution and a
new lingular opacity (pneumonia versus asymmetric pulmonary
edema), and a small calcified granuloma in the right upper
lobe (as previously demonstrated).

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
patient was admitted to the C-MED Service, placed on
telemetry, and continued on his outpatient cardiac
medications, as well as a nitroglycerin, heparin, and
Integrilin drips.

1.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  At baseline, the
patient had been on 2 liters nasal cannula of home oxygen.
His oxygen requirement remained stable while in house on 3
liters nasal cannula.  He was saturating at 97%.

An echocardiogram was performed on [**3264-8-14**] which
demonstrated an ejection fraction of 20% with global
hypokinesis; consistent with prior examination.

The patient was continued on digoxin 0.25 mg by mouth once
per day and Lasix 80 mg intravenously once per day.  Daily
weights and strict ins-and-outs were monitored.  On the day
of discharge, the patient no longer had edema of the lower
extremities.  He was saturating at 100% on 2 liters with his
lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.

2.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient ruled in by
enzyme criteria; however, his electrocardiogram continued to
be unchanged with a left bundle-branch block at baseline.

There was consideration of catheterization during this
inpatient stay; however, given the patient's complications
with gastrointestinal bleeds, as well as his reluctance to
undergo this procedure, this was deferred.

The patient underwent a chemical stress MIBI on [**3264-8-19**]; during which time he had no anginal symptoms or
interpretable electrocardiogram changes.  By verbal report,
the nuclear portion of this study demonstrated fixed defects
in the anterior/inferior walls with an ejection fraction of
20% and left ventricular cavity enlargement.

3.  ANEMIA/GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  The patient had an
episode of melena on the morning of [**3264-8-15**].  He
denied bright red blood per rectum, hematemesis,
coffee-grounds emesis, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
He had never had symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding in the
past.

A nasogastric lavage demonstrated no active upper
gastrointestinal bleed, and his vital signs remained stable
with a stable hematocrit at 29.8.  Two large-bore intravenous
lines were placed, and the patient was transfused a total of
three units of packed red blood cells with 80 mg of
intravenous Lasix prior to this transfusion.  He was also
started on Protonix 40 mg intravenously twice per day.  The
Integrilin, heparin, and aspirin were held.

A Gastroenterology consultation was obtained, and an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was recommended and performed on
the morning of [**3264-8-16**].  This demonstrated gastritis.
Nevertheless, due to the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding
he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit because
of concern over the initial hematocrit drop from 33 to 26
with a question of potential retroperitoneal bleed.

On [**3264-8-15**], when he was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, an abdominal and pelvic computed
tomography without contrast was obtained which demonstrated
some cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis, and
no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.

An anemia workup was continued, and iron studies demonstrated
an elevated ferritin and decreased total iron-binding
capacity suggesting likely anemia of chronic disease with
acute anemia secondary to gastritis superimposed.

The patient remained stable and was transferred back to the
C-MED Service on the evening of [**3264-8-16**].  For the
duration of his inpatient course, the patient's hematocrit
remained stable at 32.7, and he did not experience subsequent
episodes of melena or hematemesis.

Of note, the aspirin, heparin, and Integrilin continued to be
held (this contributed to the unwillingness to perform
cardiac catheterization during this inpatient stay).

4.  PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  On admission chest x-ray, the patient
was noted to have a lingular infiltrate that was felt to be
new compared to prior studies.  Of note, the patient's white
blood cell count was 7.8, but he did spike to 102.3 degrees
Fahrenheit on [**3264-8-15**].  Thus, it was felt that the
chest x-ray infiltrate was consistent with pneumonia, and he
was started on levofloxacin 500 mg once per day for a 10-day
course.

The patient's chest x-ray gradually improved during his
inpatient stay.  On the day of discharge, his temperature was
99.6 with a white blood cell count of 13.3.  Of note, his
maximum white blood cell count had been 13.9.  The patient
had been afebrile for 48 hours prior to discharge.

5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on an
insulin sliding-scale with four times per day fingersticks.
His glucose remained within normal limits during this
hospital course.

6.  MENTAL STATUS CHANGE ISSUES:  The patient was minimally
agitated during his Medical Intensive Care Unit stay.  It was
felt that this was likely baseline dementia with superimposed
Intensive Care Unit delirium.  He did have a recent head
computed tomography which showed no acute event.

Of note, his mental status was much improved upon transfer to
the floor.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:   The patient was discharged on [**3264-8-19**].  His vital signs were stable.  He was saturating at
100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  His creatine kinase levels
had been dropping from 187 to 108 with a troponin of 0.31.
He was asymptomatic.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Acute non-ST-segment myocardial infarction.
2.  Pneumonia.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Gastrointestinal bleed.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lipitor 20 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Celexa 20 mg by mouth by mouth twice per day.
3.  Doxazosin 2-mg tablets one tablet by mouth once per day.
4.  Timolol eyedrops 0.25% one both eyes q.a.m.
5.  Levofloxacin 500-mg tablets one tablet by mouth once per
day (for a 10-day course with day one being on [**3264-8-15**]).
6.  Lisinopril 40 mg by mouth once per day.
7.  Digoxin 250-mg tablets one tablet by mouth once per day.
8.  Carvedilol 12.5 mg by mouth twice per day.
9.  Protonix 40-mg tablets one tablet by mouth twice per day.

     Comparison is made to prior chest radiographs of [**3264-1-29**] and [**8-14**], 2003.
     
     The heart is enlarged but stable in size.  There is persistent upper zone
     vascular redistribution and perihilar haziness.  Additionally, there is an
     area of increased opacity in the lingula which obscures the left heart border.
     Note is made of disruption and malalignment of the sternal wires which is
     unchanged dating back to [**3264-1-26**].
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Confluent lingular opacity concerning for pneumonia.  When the patient's
     condition permits, more complete evaluation with standard PA and lateral chest
     radiographs is recommended.
     2)  Mild congestive heart failure pattern.
     3)  Malalignment and disruption of multiple sternal wires which appears to be
     chronic.  This may be due to a chronic sternal dehiscence.

     pain and fever.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3353-1-11**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained following the administration of oral contrast and 100 cc of Optiray.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The airways are patent to the level of
     segmental bronchi bilaterally.  There are no pericardial effusions.  There is
     a tiny right-sided pleural effusion.  The image quality is degraded by
     patient's poor breathhold.  No significantly-enlarged axillary, mediastinal,
     or hilar lymph nodes are seen.  Again seen are small nodules, less optimally
     visualized on today's study secondary to poor breathhold.  There is a nodular
     density measuring 5 mm seen on series 2, image 28 in the right middle lobe,
     which is new and nonspecific.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is an extensive amount of free air
     seen in the abdomen surrounding the liver and extending inferiorly to the
     level of the umbilicus.  There is a moderate amount of free fluid surrounding
     the liver, spleen, both paracolic gutters and extending and into the pelvis
     surrounding the bladder.  The free fluid is of low attenuation.  Oral contrast
     is seen through loops of small bowel, and there is no active extravasation of
     oral contrast identified.  The loops of small bowel, specifically, the ileal
     loops, are thickened and abnormal in appearance, and in this patient, graft
     versus host disease is also a consideration.
     
     No significantly-enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes are seen.  The previously
     seen periportal lymph node is again identified on series 2B, image 75, not
     significantly changed.
     
     The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  There is no

     pain and fever.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3353-1-11**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained following the administration of oral contrast and 100 cc of Optiray.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The airways are patent to the level of
     segmental bronchi bilaterally.  There are no pericardial effusions.  There is
     a tiny right-sided pleural effusion.  The image quality is degraded by
     patient's poor breathhold.  No significantly-enlarged axillary, mediastinal,
     or hilar lymph nodes are seen.  Again seen are small nodules, less optimally
     visualized on today's study secondary to poor breathhold.  There is a nodular
     density measuring 5 mm seen on series 2, image 28 in the right middle lobe,
     which is new and nonspecific.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is an extensive amount of free air
     seen in the abdomen surrounding the liver and extending inferiorly to the
     level of the umbilicus.  There is a moderate amount of free fluid surrounding
     the liver, spleen, both paracolic gutters and extending and into the pelvis
     surrounding the bladder.  The free fluid is of low attenuation.  Oral contrast
     is seen through loops of small bowel, and there is no active extravasation of
     oral contrast identified.  The loops of small bowel, specifically, the ileal
     loops, are thickened and abnormal in appearance, and in this patient, graft
     versus host disease is also a consideration.
     
     No significantly-enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes are seen.  The previously
     seen periportal lymph node is again identified on series 2B, image 75, not
     significantly changed.
     
     The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  There is no
     hydronephrosis or hydroureter on either side.  Again, seen are exophytic

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       63 year old man with h/o ESRD on HD with new SVC syndrome, poorly functioning 
      L  AVF.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      functioning AVF, clots in upper torso?                                          
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     HISTORY: 63 year old male with end stage renal disease on dialysis through
     left arm brachiocephalic arteriovenous (AV) fistula, now presents with
     significant swelling of left face and both arms with left side being worse.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 603**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 470**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 291**] [**Doctor Last Name 292**] d'Othee, with the attending
     radiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 292**] [**Name (STitle) 293**] being present for the entire procedure. Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 212**] reviewed the exam.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The risks and benefits were explained to the patient
     and consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the angiographic
     table and the right arm was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Local
     anesthesia using 1% Lidocaine was applied to the puncture site. Under
     sonographic guidance, the left cephalic vein near the arteriovenous fistula
     was accessed using a 21 gauge needle and an 0.018 wire was placed into the
     vein toward the venous side. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture
     sheath which was connected to the power injector.
     AV fistulogram was performed along the course of the cephalic vein to the
     level of the right atrium. The venograms demonstrated a focal stenosis in the
     dilated cephalic vein at the level of the mid arm and also confirmed the
     known, severe stenosis of the superior vena cava (SVC). There is a left
     internal jugular dialysis catheter with its tip in the SVC. This might be
     related to the development of the stenosis. No intrathoracic collateral is
     seen; there is, however, collateral filling from the left mid-arm towards the
     axilla and then left lateral thoracic wall caudally.
     Pressure measurements were performed through a 5-French straight catheter.
     They demonstrated mean pressures of 13 mmHg in the right atrium and 31 mmHg in
     the left brachiocephalic vein (i.e., gradient of 18 mmHg).
     A pressure cuff was insufflated over the upper arm and a venogram was
     repeated. It revealed patency of the arteriovenous anastomosis and the
     brachial artery proximally and distally to the anastomosis with no significant
     stenosis.
                                                                 (Over)

     Thereafter, an 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 471**] wire was placed through the sheath and advanced
     under fluoroscopy until its tip was in the inferior vena cava. The
     micropuncture sheath was exchanged for a 6 French sheath. The focal stenosis
     in the cephalic vein was dilated using a 6 mm X 4 cm balloon. Resolution of
     the narrowing was shown on a follow-up venogram.
     The sheath was removed and a 18 mm X 4 cm balloon was placed over the wire
     into the stenotic SVC and dilated repeatedly under fluoroscopy up to 5
     atmospheres. Follow up venograms through the sidearm of the sheath showed
     significant improvement of the diameter of the SVC. Repeat pressure
     measurements through a 4 French multiside hole straight catheter showed
     complete resolution of pressure gradient across the superior vena cava.
     The catheter and sheath were then removed and local hemostasis was achieved by
     manual compression. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no
     complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS: For conscious sedation, a total of 75 micrograms of Fentanyl was
     given in small divided intravenous doses under continuous hemodynamic
     monitoring. Total of 165 ml IV Optiray 320 dilated by half.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Major, symptomatic stenosis of the superior vena cava. Low-pressure
     balloon venoplasty (18 mm) resulted in highly satisfactory immediate
     angiographic and manometric results.
     
     2.  Focal stenosis in the left cephalic vein at the mid-arm level. This was
     dilated to 6 mm in diameter with no immediate complication.

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 85 yo man with metastatic gall bladder cancer presents 
w/ weakness, disorientation and dehydration. Pt was diagnosed 
with cancer 1 year ago and underwent surgery 5 months ago 
secondary to increasing RUQ abdominal pain. He remained stable 
until about 1 month ago when he began to feel progressively 
weaker and have less of an appetite. Pt usually slept 18-20 
hours per day and when awake would like in a chair in front of 
the television and only sip broth when forced. For the past 3 
days pt has had almost no intake po. This morning grandson 
describes pt as somnolent and not arousable to voice. He states 
that pt would stare at him but not respond and was unable to 
answer his name or where he was. he called pts pcp who advised 
him to come to the ED.  
.  
Per pts grandson, during the past month patient has complained 
of increasing abdominal pain, mid to low back pain, weakness, 
fatigue and decreased appetite. Pt would only take in sips on 
broth when forced. Pts grandson estimates that he has lost about 
40lbs in the last month. Per Pts grandson, he has not complained 
of nausea, vomiting, fever or chills. He has had minimal urine 
output. ON ROS, pt is moderately responsive and denies any pain. 
 

 
Past Medical History:
-gallbladder carcinoma, small cell type. dx [**3497-1-10**],

Brief Hospital Course:
#) metastatic gall bladder cancer: Pt presented with common bile 
duct obstruction [**2-11**] tumor effect from gallbladder mass. There 
was a palpable abdominal mass on PE and progressively increasing 
transaminases, bilirubin, alk phos. Pt also developed an upper 
GI bleed with hematemesis at presentation. GI, GI [**Doctor First Name **], ERCP and 
IR were consulted re: possible interventions. Stenting was not 
an option given pts anatomy/obstruction during past surgery and 
pt was not thought to be stable enough for IR intervention for 
the bleeding.  Pt was transfused and stabilized in the MICU.  He 
has been hemodynamically stable with no continued hematemesis. 
Hct has been stable between 27-29. 

After discussion with patients family the decision was made for 
care measure only.

Pt has been pain controlled with morphine IV and SL. He is very 
stoic and often denies pain to the medical team but has 
complained to his family. 

He has been tolerating clear fluids w/o problem.

His family visits him every day. 
 
Medications on Admission:
percocet 5-325mg TID prn for pain  
patient has not been taking: cimetidine 400mg BID and metoprolol 
25mg daily

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
89 y/o M with PMH of afib, DMII, hypercholesterolemia 
transferered to [**Hospital1 83**] on [**6-7**] for evaluation of subdural 
hematoma. The patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] ED after 
having a syncopal episode on the morning of [**2849-6-7**]. Pt states 
that he went to his bathroom at 8 am to take a bath and was 
standing, turning on the fawcet and the next thing he remembers 
is finding himself lying on his back in the tub. [**Hospital3 **] 
notes state that patient felt lightheaded prior to fall but 
patient later denied this. He denied any HA, CP or palpitations, 
shortness of breath, diaphoresis, dizziness/LH prior to fall. 
His daughter then called him at 9 am to help take him to an 
opthalmology appt, but pt did not answer phone. Ten minutes 
later daughter called him again and his father sounded "breathy, 
winded" and that he did not need to go to the doctor's office 
today and then his voice trailed off. The daughter then arrived 
at his apartment and found his father asleep in bed but with 
lacerations on both of his feet, specifically left toes. In 
bathroom, shower curtain rod was down on floor. Patient did not 
appear confused but seemed "out of it", no dysarthria, answered 
questions appropriately, no numbness/weakness in extremities, 
unclear if stool incontinence (soiled underwear in bathroom but 
often happens at baseline). Per daughters, patient has not taken 
his meds in 3 days, unclear if change in PO intake.  

ROS on admission: +HA frontal and temporal "behind eyes", no 
dizziness/LH, +neck pain secondary to collar, no melena, no 
BRBPR, no vision changes, no dysarthria, no n/v/abd pain, no 
sob. Daughters state he has had falls in past after feeling 
dizziness/LH prior.  
  
At [**Hospital3 **] ED, found to have small L subdural hematoma with 
no midline shift or mass effect. Was transferred to [**Hospital1 83**] for 
further neurosurgical evaluation. Here in our ED, neuro exam 
unremarkable. CT head without contrast confirmed right frontal 
subdural hematoma as well as low attenuation regions in L 
frontal and L anterior temporal lobes c/w infarctions and age 
indeterminant. CT C-spine with no fracture. No urgent 
neurosurgical intervention deemed necessary but admitted to ICU 
for q1hr neuro checks. Also given 10 mg Vitamin K and 2 units 
FFP for INR 2.0.

CXR [**2849-6-7**]:  
1. Cardiomegaly. No overt CHF or pulmonary consolidations.  
2. Coarse bilateral interstitial markings, which may be chronic 
in nature.  
Comparison with prior outside radiographs is recommended, if 
available.  
 
CT C-spine [**2849-6-7**]: Degenerative disease with no evidence of 
acute fracture. Straightening of the normal cervical lordosis. 
Emphysematous disease of the lung apices.  
  
CT head without contrast [**6-7**]: isodense, extraaxial material c/w 
right frontal subdural hematoma; low attenuation regions in L 
frontal and L ant temporal lobes c/w infarctions, age 
indeterminate  
  
CT head without contrast [**6-8**]: No significant interval change 
from previous day's study.  
  
Echo [**2849-6-8**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right 
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function appears 
preserved (ejection fraction ?55%) but views are suboptimal. Due 
to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately 
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. 
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**12-27**]+) 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There 
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion.  

EKG: slow afib, rate 50 bpm, TWI III, V1 and V2; flat AVF, V4 
and V6, no baseline for comparison  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. Subdural hematoma. 89 y/o M with h/o afib, CAD, 
hypercholesterolemia who presented s/p syncopal fall with new 
subdural hematoma. SDH was felt to be likely a consequence of 
the syncopal fall. Patient was initially admitted to ICU for 
close neurological monitoring and remained neurologically 
stable. C-spine was cleared. Head CT was repeated in 24 hours to 
assess for interval changes and SDH appearance was stable. 
Neurosurgery recommended to hold anticoagulation for 4 weeks and 
to keep platelets >100 for 7 days after the event. The patient 
may continue Aspirin. The follow up appointment with 
neurosurgery was arranged for the patient. He will follow up 
with neurosurgery in 3 months and will have CT head repeated 
prior to the appointment. 

2. Syncope. Etiology of syncopal fall was not entirely clear. As 
part of work up for syncope, the patient was ruled out for MI 
with two sets of enzymes. Carotid US was done and showed <40% 
bilateral carotid artery stenosis. Echo was unrevealing. CT head 
was negative for acute pathology that would explain syncopal 
event. The etiology of his syncope was felt possibly to be due 
to orthostasis. The patient was orthostatic initially on the 
floor. Cosyntropin stim test was done to r/o adrenal 
insufficiency was normal. Tamsulosin was discontinued to 
eliminate this as a cause of the patient's syncopal fall. The 
patient was transfused one units of pRBCs and platelets and his 
orthostasis has resolved. The possibility that he was dehydrated 
from Lasix and/or poor po intake prior to admission was 
entertained to explain his orthostasis. Electrophysiology were 
consulted with the question of whether patient's slow a fib 
could have caused his syncope (patient with a fib with rate down 
to high 30's on telemetry at night) and whether he would be a 
candidate for a pacemaker. They felt that this was unlikely and 
that no further EP investigation was warranted. 

3. Renal failure. Patient had mild elevation of creatinine on 
admission from his baseline Cr of around 2.0. Lasix was held and 
his Cr remained stable and was 1.7 at the time of discharge. 

4. Atrial fibrillation. The patient has been in slow afib with 
HR down to high 30's when asleep. He was asymptomatic. Coumadin 
was held given new SDH. Digoxin level was checked on admission 
and was 0.5. Digoxin was held given his slow rate. EP did not 
think that his syncope was from cardiac cause and felt that a 
pacemaker was not necessary. They recommended Holter as an 
outpatient. Given patient's slow heart rate, his digoxin should 
not be restarted. If the patient starts having rapid atrial 
fibrillation, EP recommended metoprolol for rate control. 

5. Thrombocytopenia. From [**Hospital3 **] and [**Hospital1 1090**] records appears 
to have baseline in low 100s. No obvious offensive medications. 
No splenomegaly on exam. Consider BM bx as outpatient given 
anemia and thrombocytopenia.  

6. Hypercholesterolemia. The patient was continued on Statin. 
    
7. HTN. The patient was not on any antihypertensive [**Doctor Last Name 614**]. His 
SBP were mostly within the normal range. If he needs to be 
started on a medication for BP control, would favor starting a 
beta-blocker as heart rate tolerates. 

8. H/o CVA, remote. This was an incidental finding on CT head. 
The patient was continued on aspirin 81 mg.   

9. CHF. The patient has a h/o systolic dysfunction and EF around 
30%. Echocardiogram was repeated here as part of work up for 
syncope and showed EF 55% but mild LVH. Diuretics have been held 
during this hospital admission as the patent appeared euvolemic 
and because of slight increase in creatinine from baseline. The 
patient will need to be closely monitored for signs of 
decompensated CHF with daily weight. He needs to be on low Na 
diet. Lasix can be given on as needed basis.   

10. Indirect bilirubinemia, mild. Work up showed no signs of 
intravascular hemolysis. This felt likely to be secondary to 
hematomas after the fall.  
 
11. Anemia, macrocytic. Baseline HCT 36-38 from [**Hospital1 1090**] records. 
Patient had slow decreased in HCT of about 3 points from 
admission and remained hemodynamically stable. There was no 
evidence of hemolysis. Stool guaiacs were negative. Fe studies 
were not consistent with iron deficiency anemia. B12 level was 
low normal and the patient was started on B12 supplements. 
Reticulocyte index was low 2.1% (not adjusted). The patient is 
discharged on Epogen given his renal insufficiency. The patient 
received a total of 2 units of pRBCs today for orthostatic 
hypotension. UPEP and SPEP were checked and were normal.

12. BPH. Flomax was stopped to eliminate this as a cause of 
orthostatis.   

13. DM. Glycemic control was initially maintained with Insulin 
sliding scale. The patient was then restarted on Avandia. His 
finger sticks were mostly in low 100's.   

14. Secondary Hyperparathyroidism. Serum calcium was nornal but 
the patient did have an elevated Alk Phos and high PTH. His 
secondary hyperparathyroidism is possibly due to chronic renal 
insufficiency. The patient was started on Vitamin D supplements.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Sixty-eight year old man with NSTE MI, rising Troponin, s/p CABG, low
     EF, hematocrit drop.
     
     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
     Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142  
     mg/kg/min. Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-99m sestamibi was
     administered IV.
     
     INTERPRETATION: 
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201.
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
     
     Stress images show moderate left ventricular enlargement which does not change
     during resting perfusion images.
     
     Stress images show a moderate perfusion defect in the anterior wall which is
     unchanged in resting perfusion images.  Stress images show a moderate perfusion
     defect in the inferior wall which does not change in the resting perfusion
     images.  Stress images show a mild perfusion defect in the septum which is also
     unchanged on the resting perfusion images.
     
     Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
     Dipyridamole administration is 19%.  There is global hypokinesis.
     
     Compared to prior study from [**3264-1-29**], the partial reversibility on the moderate
     perfusion defect of the anterior wall in no longer seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1) Moderate, fixed left ventricular enlargement.  2) Moderate,
     fixed perfusion defects in the anterior and inferior walls, mild, fixed
     perfusion defect in the septal wall.  Decreased EF of 19%.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lethargy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 48-year-old HIV
positive African-American male with a history of
polysubstance abuse, hepatitis C, cirrhosis and hypertension
who was admitted to [**Hospital 10736**] Hospital on [**2778-3-20**], for
detox following a recent binge using crack cocaine (about one
gram per day), alcohol (one pint of wine per day) and Xanax
and Klonopin while on Methadone maintenance.  On [**2778-3-22**], he was noted to have fluctuating mental status
(somnolence, disorientation) and after being found down
beside his bed confused, with a bloody nose and a blood
pressure of 170/130, he was presumed to have had a seizure.
He was given 1 mg of Ativan and was brought to the [**Hospital1 184**] Emergency Department.
Following a negative head CT, no further seizures and stable
vital signs, the patient was discharged back to Bornwood on
an Ativan taper.  On [**2778-3-23**], the patient was reported
to be lethargic and ataxic, with a blood pressure of 150/100.
EMT brought the patient back to [**Hospital1 47**] Emergency Department, where his vital signs included a
blood pressure of 190/90, pulse of 88 and a respiratory rate
of 4, satting 94% on room air.  The patient was barely
responsive to sternal rub, with constricted pupils and was
started on Narcan, receiving a dose of 0.06 mg/hour with good
effect.  He was admitted to the MICU in the early a.m. on
[**2778-3-24**].  It was difficult to obtain additional history
from the patient at this time.  Subsequently it was learned
that the patient received some OxyContin 40 mg from a friend
while at detox, and remembers taking it prior to admission to
the hospital, although he is unclear as to what day he took
it.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  HIV positive since [**2763-4-19**].  A CD4 count of 78 with an
undetectable viral load was noted in [**2777-10-18**] as per the
patient's primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9780**].  The
patient has a history of thrush as per previous dictation
summaries.  There is a question of a history of PCP in the
past.  The patient was on HAART, but this was discontinued in
the fall of last year because of decompensating liver disease
in the setting of hepatitis C.
2.  Multisubstance abuse including intravenous drug abuse.
The patient has a long-standing history of multisubstance
abuse going back 25 years that includes intravenous heroin
and cocaine abuse, benzodiazepine use including Xanax and
Klonopin, and ethanol.  The patient has been in and out of
rehabilitation facilities in the past, stays on long term
Methadone maintenance.  While the patient does admit to
recent use of cocaine, ethanol, and benzodiazepines, he
denies use of heroin for several months, stating that he does
not crave heroin while he is on Methadone.
3.  Hepatitis C positive.  The patient has active hepatitis C
disease with a high viral load and is not a candidate for
therapy at this time considering his current treatment for
depression.  His albumin has been as low as 2.5 in the past
but has improved since holding HAART therapy.  He has no
history of ascites or gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient
falls between Child Class B and C cirrhosis.
4.  Pan cytopenia likely secondary to HIV and ethanol abuse.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Depression.
7.  History of tuberculosis exposure.
8.  History of bacterial endocarditis, Staph positive in the
past (1988 and 1995 hospitalizations).
9.  History of sternoclavicular septic arthritis in [**2769**].
10. Status post motor vehicle accident with head trauma.
11. Bilateral leg pain and numbness secondary to peripheral
neuropathy.
12. Status post appendectomy.
13. Status post inguinal hernia repair.
14. Question of a distant history of seizure.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:
1.  Methadone 55 mg q. day.
2.  Prozac 20 mg q. day.
3.  Ativan 1 mg t.i.d. taper.
4.  Thiamine.
5.  Folate.
6.  Clonidine 0.2 t.i.d. p.r.n.
7.  Motrin 400 mg q. 4h. p.r.n.
8.  Mylanta 30 cc q. 4h. p.r.n.
9.  Ativan 1 mg p.o. q. 4h. p.r.n.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife in
[**Location (un) **] and has five children and several grandchildren.
He is retired since [**2774**] after working for American Airlines
as a ramp worker.  He now lives on SSI with Mass Health and
Veterans benefits that cover his medications.  As previously
mentioned, he has an extensive history of intravenous drug
abuse that includes intravenous heroin and cocaine abuse that
extends back for decades.  His recent binge was attributed to
increased depression of recent time because of his inability
to stay clean, his cirrhosis and chronic illnesses, a recent
fight with his wife, multiple deaths in the family, and an
upcoming court date next week for a DUI that he was arrested
for in January of this year.  The patient has a one pack per
day smoking history and, while he denies extensive abuse of
alcohol, he does admit to recently drinking one pint or one
bottle of wine per day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has allergy to Bactrim that causes
him to have a rash.  The patient has an allergy to nafcillin
which has also given him exfoliative dermatitis of the palms
and soles in the past.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's mother is healthy at age 83.
The patient's father is 82 years old, suffering from diabetes
mellitus.  The patient has two sisters who have died of
cancer, one at the age of 58 and one who passed away in her
20's.  There is no family history of substance abuse.  There
is a question of a history of depression in the patient's
mother.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  At admission the patient denied
complaints of headache, chest pain, shortness of breath,
nausea, vomiting, fevers or chills.  He had no complaints of
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain at the time.  No
dysuria or increased urinary frequency.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination at presentation to the Intensive Care Unit floor
the patient had the following vital signs:  He was afebrile
with a heart rate of 75, blood pressure of 139/101, a
respiratory rate of 18 and he was saturating 100% on room
air.  General appearance:  The patient was very somnolent,
but responsive to questions and without tremulousness.  On
examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, the
patient was normocephalic, atraumatic.  Mucus membranes were
dry.  Pupils were 4 mm and reactive to light bilaterally.
The patient's neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.  On
pulmonary examination the lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally without wheezes or crackles.  On cardiovascular
examination, there was a normal rate and rhythm with normal
S1, S2.  A systolic murmur was appreciated at the apex.  On
abdominal examination normal bowel sounds were present.  The
abdomen was soft, non-tender and non-distended.  The
extremities were without edema or cyanosis.  On neurological
examination, the patient was alert and oriented times three.
Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  No focal motor
deficits were appreciated.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had
the following laboratories on admission:  A complete blood
count revealed a white blood cell count of 1.9 with an ANC of
700, hematocrit of 32.5 and a platelet count of 53,000.
Chem-7 (hemolyzed) showed a sodium of 137, potassium of 4.8,
chloride of 103, bicarbonate of 31, BUN of 13, creatinine of
0.8 and a glucose of 118.  A serum tox screen for aspirin,
ethanol, acetaminophen, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, TCA
was negative.

RADIOLOGY/STUDIES AT ADMISSION:
1.  Electrocardiogram:  Sinus rhythm, with left ventricular
hypertrophy and left atrial abnormality.  Nonspecific ST
changes were observed.  Q2 prolongation that is new on this
EKG was observed compared with previous [**2772-1-23**] EKG.
2.  Chest x-ray:  Mild to moderate cardiac enlargement with
prominent left ventricle contour.  Wide thoracic aorta.  No
evidence of pulmonary congestion or infiltrates.
3.  Head CT:  Head CT from [**2778-3-22**] Emergency Department visit
showed mild focal dilatation, with a normal ventricular
system.  No midline shift, mass, mass effect, hemorrhage was
observed.  Chronic paranasal sinus disease was noted.

IMPRESSION AT ADMISSION:  This is a 45-year-old
African-American male with a history of polysubstance abuse,
HIV and hepatitis C who came to the Emergency Department with
stuporous mental status changes from detox facility.  This
was felt to be most likely from an opiate overdose, as the
patient appeared to respond to Narcan while in the Emergency
Department.  Infection as a possible etiology for mental
status changes could not be completely ruled out in this HIV
positive patient with his last CD4 count of 78.  However, the
patient does recall taking an extra 40 mg of OxyContin prior
to admission on top of his maintenance Methadone dose of 55
mg per day and benzodiazepine taper that he had been started
on after his [**2778-3-22**] Emergency Department visit, making
overdose more likely.

HOSPITAL COURSE IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:
[**Unit Number **].  Neurological:  Patient's mental status changes which
included increased lethargy to stuporousness, pinpoint pupils
and decreased respiratory rate in the setting of Methadone,
benzodiazepine and opiate use make opiate overdose the most
likely cause of this patient's presentation.  The patient
showed good response to naloxone throughout his stay in the
Intensive Care Unit which was continued as a drip until [**2778-3-25**], with dramatic improvement in the patient's state of
alertness.  Other causes for his change in mental status
included withdrawal from benzodiazepines and alcohol,
electrolyte abnormalities, infection, intracranial processes,
as well as renal hepatic disease.  For that reason,
electrolytes were followed, calcium, magnesium, phosphate
levels were sent.  An LP was also performed.  The patient was
pan cultured, including cultures for blood, urine and
cerebrospinal fluid.  Because of the patient's history of
alcohol and benzodiazepine use with the last alcohol use
likely on [**2778-3-20**], there was a possibility of
withdrawal in this patient, so a CIWA protocol with diazepam
q. 4h. for a score greater than 10.  Clonidine p.r.n. was
also continued for the possibility of developing opiate
withdrawal.  In this patient with depression, his Prozac was
held while he was in the Intensive Care Unit.  A Neurology
consult felt that the seizure on [**2778-3-22**], was most
likely secondary to a combination of withdrawal from both
alcohol and benzodiazepines.  As recent cocaine was evident
in the urine tox screen, there was some concern of a cerebral
infarct, but a negative CT and nonfocal neuro examination
made this less likely.  Liver function tests and ammonia were
also sent in this patient with a history of hepatitis C.

Patient's laboratory values while in the Intensive Care Unit
on [**2778-3-24**], included a calcium of 8.0, magnesium of 1.4
and a phosphate of 3.1.  The patient's PT was 13.7, INR was
1.2 and PTT was 37.7.  The patient had an elevated AST of
101, an ALT of 52, an alkaline phosphatase of 129, and a
total bilirubin of 0.8.  His albumin was 2.7 and was repeated
that same day and found to be 3.1.  Amylase was 98 and lipase
was 63.  The patient had an ammonia elevated to 95 with no
history of previous baseline ammonia recorded in the past.  A
urine tox screen was positive for cocaine and Methadone and
negative for benzodiazepines.  An LP was performed on [**2778-3-24**], which showed 0 white blood cells, 6 red blood cells,
a protein of 37, and a glucose of 57.  The Gram stain was
negative for PMNs, no microorganisms were seen.  Cryptococcal
antigen was not detected, and fluid, acid fast, viral, and
fungal cultures were sent.

2.  Infectious Disease:  This patient is HIV positive and
hepatitis C positive, and it is possible that infection could
also be an underlying cause of his mental status changes.  As
mentioned he was pan cultured, including blood, urine, CSF
and stool cultures.  Tests for CD4 count and viral load were
sent.  The patient reported that he has not been on
retrovirals since the fall of last year.  Liver function
tests were ordered to follow up the status of his cirrhosis,
and were elevated as previously mentioned in this dictation.
Throughout the patient's duration in the Intensive Care Unit,
he did not complain of fevers, shortness of breath or
productive cough, dysuria, or other complaints suggestive of
infectious process.

3.  Pulmonary:  The patient's respiratory rate improved on
Narcan drip while in the Intensive Care Unit and there was no
need to intubate.

4.  Cardiac:  The patient has a history of hypertension and
has used beta blockers in the past.  He has not been on his
hypertensive medication during the past several days while at
detox.  His pressures remained elevated while in the
Intensive Care Unit.  In the evening of [**2778-3-24**], he was
hypertensive to 206 and was given a dose of hydralazine for
control of his pressure.  Subsequently, lisinopril 5 mg q.
day and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q. day were begun to better
control his pressure.  The patient's EKG showed an increased
QT prolongation from prior EKG, in the setting of a potassium
of 3.4 upon repeat Chem-7 on [**2778-3-24**].  It was unclear
that any of the other medicines that the patient were taking
should be associated with causing this QT prolongation.  The
patient's potassium was repleted.

5.  Hematology.  The patient's pan cytopenia was noted on
CBC.  This was stable throughout his stay in the Intensive
Care Unit.

6.  Renal/Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition.  The patient
was given maintenance fluids of one-half normal saline 100 cc
per hour.  These were maintained until the patient's mental
status improved.  He began tolerating p.o.'s on [**2778-3-25**].  Because of the patient's elevated ammonia, he was
placed on a low protein diet once he was able to tolerate
p.o.'s.  Electrolytes were followed daily and were repleted
as necessary, with potassium and magnesium requiring
repletion.  The patient was placed on thiamine, folate and a
multivitamin considering the patient's history of alcohol
abuse.

7.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient has a history of cirrhosis
in the setting of HAART use that was discontinued in [**2777-10-18**] with a history of ethanol abuse.  He has had elevated
transaminases, PT and albumin of 3.1 and elevated ammonia.
Lactulose was started at 30 cc t.i.d., titrated to less than
two stools per day to treat the elevated ammonia.  Hepatitis
C serologies were not sent at this time and will likely be
followed as an outpatient.

8.  Prophylaxis.  The patient was placed on subcu heparin and
Pepcid IV q. day.

SUMMARY OF INTENSIVE CARE UNIT STAY:  The patient's mental
status continued to improve on Narcan drip which was weaned
over 12 hours to a respiratory rate greater than 11.
Cultures remained negative during the ICU stay.  The patient
was able to tolerate p.o.'s prior to transfer.  Vital signs
were stable, although his blood pressures remained elevated
prior to transfer.  The patient was transferred to the East
Campus [**Company **] Service on [**2778-3-25**].

HOSPITAL COURSE ON THE FLOOR ([**2778-3-25**] to [**2778-3-27**]):
1.  Neurological:  On arrival to the floor, the patient was
breathing comfortably in no acute distress and was alert and
oriented with some depressed mood.  He did complain of some
symptoms of nausea, chills, diaphoresis, aches and pains,
diarrhea, that he thought were consistent with his typical
withdrawal symptoms.  He was continued on the CIWA protocol
with p.r.n. diazepam, and clonidine was continued for his
complaints of opiate withdrawal.  His Methadone was begun on
the floor at a dose of 55 mg q. day.  Lactulose was also
considered in light of his elevated ammonia, although
encephalopathy appeared to be unlikely in this patient with
no asterixis or additional changes in mental status.  We
continued to follow daily labs which showed a white blood
cell count of 1.7, hematocrit of 32.6 and a platelet count of
47,000, with an ANC of 740.  Electrolytes showed a sodium of
137, potassium 3.3, chloride 107, bicarbonate 22, BUN 8,
creatinine 0.5 and glucose 98.  Calcium was 7.5, magnesium
1.8 and phosphate was 3.0.  While the PT and INR were now
normal, PTT remained slightly elevated at 39.  The patient
was offered a nicotine patch for his nicotine addiction which
he declined.  The patient's mental status continued to be
stable during his stay on the floor, with no signs of overt
anxiety, hallucinations, instability, but the patient was
somewhat depressed and nervous, which he admitted was
primarily due to his worry about personal stressors.  His
symptoms of opiate withdrawal were also negligible during his
second and third days on the floor.  Prozac was restarted on
his last day of admission for depression.  It appeared that
the patient had very few symptoms of ethanol withdrawal,
however, his blood pressure did remain elevated throughout
his stay but without tachycardia.  The patient's symptoms of
opiate withdrawal seemed to be well controlled on his
Methadone maintenance dose although the patient did receive
one to two doses of benzodiazepine per day, and requested
clonidine on his final day of admission p.r.n.  However, the
patient does admit that he feels better than he has in years
physically but admits that it is psychological problems and
depression that make him feel most concerned at this time.
We had several discussions with the patient regarding the
seriousness of this hospital admission and the risk of poor
outcome if he continues such risky behaviors, as this
overdose might have been life threatening.  The patient is
actually quite thoughtful and clearly depressed with his
current health situation, living environment ("my
neighborhood is full of drugs"), and life stressors (several
deaths in the recent past in his family).

2.  Infectious Disease.  The patient's CD4 count was found to
be 48 during this admission and his viral load is still
pending.  The patient remained afebrile throughout his
admission, without complaints of fever, productive cough,
dysuria, abdominal pain, or other clinical signs concerning
for infection.  Blood, stool and cerebrospinal fluid cultures
have been negative to date.  Prophylaxis was begun for PCP
with dapsone and fluconazole was also started in this patient
with a history of thrush.  However, fluconazole was
discontinued prior to __________ as prophylaxis is not
indicated routinely in HIV positive patients.  As the
patient's CD4 count is below 50, toxoplasmosis titers were
also sent, and should be followed up for possible
toxoplasmosis prophylaxis as well as [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis as an
outpatient.

3.  Cardiovascular.  The patient's EKG was repeated on [**2778-3-26**], and was found to be unchanged from admission EKG,
with suddenly prolonged QT interval.  Potassium was also 3.2
on [**2778-3-26**], and was repleted.  The patient's blood
pressure continued to be elevated throughout his stay on the
floor, in the 150's to 180's over 90's to 100's.  The dose of
lisinopril was increased to 10 q. day, and it was decided
prior to discharge to change the patient's blood pressure
regimen to 10 mg lisinopril b.i.d., to discontinue the
hydrochlorothiazide, and to begin Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q. day.

4.  Pulmonary.  The patient was breathing comfortably with
normal respiratory rate and saturating well on room air
throughout his stay on the floor.  While the patient
complained of some runny nose on transfer to the floor, he
developed no other symptoms suggestive of a serious
respiratory infection.  This patient does have previous
hospitalizations because of pneumonia with a question of PCP
pneumonia in the past.

5.  Renal.  The patient had normal creatinine throughout his
hospital stay.  His urinalysis was negative except for a
negative urobilinogen in this patient with advanced liver
disease.  Urine culture was positive for group B Strep which
was an endogenous organism not considered needing to be
treated.

6.  Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition.  The patient's lytes
were followed and were repleted while he was on the floor.
Potassium remained slightly low throughout and was repleted
with 40 mEq of KCl during each of his stays on the floor and
was increased to 60 mEq on [**3-27**].  He was maintained on a
low protein diet in light of his elevated ammonia which was
up to 148 on his day of discharge.  He was continued on
thiamine, folate and multivitamin and additional B12 and
folate studies were sent and are still pending.  He tolerated
p.o. liquids and solids well throughout his stay on the
floor.  No complaints of nausea or vomiting.

7.  Gastrointestinal.  In this patient with hepatitis C
positive cirrhosis his albumin came back at 2.8 on [**2778-3-26**].  We continued to follow an ammonia which was 148 prior
to discharge, and lactulose was poorly tolerated by the
patient and was discontinued on his final day of admission.
The patient was requesting therapy options for his liver
disease and seemed most concern with this of his health
issues.  Unfortunately, Interferon therapy may be
contraindicated in this patient on Zoloft with clear symptoms
of depression.  As an outpatient it would be recommended that
he receive vaccination such as hepatitis A in light of his
liver disease.  While this patient has no prior history of
gastrointestinal bleed, we began Imd[**MD Number 5248**] GI prophylaxis,
and it is recommended that he have an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy as an outpatient.

8.  Hematology.  The patient's pan cytopenia was stable while
on the floor.  The patient did complain of a nose bleed one
morning in the setting of low platelet count that he
described as robust, but which stopped easily and did not
recur.  In light of the patient's pan cytopenia which may be
likely due to ethanol use, HIV, liver disease, it was thought
that B12 and folate should also be checked.

9.  Prophylaxis.  The patient remained on heparin subcu
b.i.d. and ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. throughout his stay
on the floor.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was in good condition at
discharge.  He was not complaining of symptoms of alcohol
withdrawal, and was maintained on CIWA protocol greater than
8 during his last three days on the floor.  Methadone
maintenance was restarted with good effect.  He was primarily
concerned with psychosocial issues of maintaining sobriety, a
safe drug-free environment, his chronic health issues, family
stressors, and tomorrow's pending court appearance.
Depression, for these reasons, is a concern in this patient
who appears to have overdosed on narcotics leading to this
admission.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged back to
[**Hospital 10736**] Hospital, where he was first admitted last Monday
([**2778-3-20**]) to begin a detox program prior to this
hospitalization.  He wishes to return to Bornwood to continue
his detox in a safe environment where he can try to address
his recurrent urges for polydrug abuse.  [**Hospital 10736**] Hospital is
located at [**Street Address 10737**] in [**Location (un) 418**], [**State 10738**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Thiamine 100 mg q. day.
2.  Folic acid 1 mg q. day.
3.  Multivitamin.
4.  Dapsone 100 mg q. day.
5.  Methadone 55 mg q. day.
6.  Fluoxetine 20 mg q. day.
7.  _____ 10 mg b.i.d.
8.  Ativan 1 mg q. 4h. p.r.n.
9.  Clonidine 0.2 mg t.i.d. p.r.n.
10. Potassium chloride 20 mEq b.i.d.
11. Norvasc 2.5 mg p.o. q. day.
12. Magnesium oxide 400 mg p.o. q. day.
13. Imdur 30 mg q. day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS AND FOLLOW UP:
1.  The patient was instructed to call his primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9780**], after discharge to set up a
follow-up appointment in one week if he desired to continue
having her involved in his care.
2.  As the patient mentioned a desire to transfer his care
from the V.A. Hospital, as he has had some negative
experiences there in the past, we have set up an appointment
for him with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Associates, [**Hospital1 184**], for this Thursday, [**3-30**], at 2:00 p.m., the [**Hospital Ward Name **] Building.  At this
appointment the patient will be able to follow up his pending
laboratory studies which include pending cultures, his viral
load, his toxoplasmosis cultures.  Also potassium and ammonia
levels should be checked at this time.  As the patient's
blood pressures have been elevated during his hospital stay
and his blood pressure control medications are still being
optimized, his blood pressure should be checked during this
visit and modification of his medical regimen should be
considered.  Pending results of the toxoplasmosis titers, the
patient should be considered for a toxo and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis,
considering his CD4 count of 48.  Also consider a hepatitis A
vaccine and confirm hepatitis B status in this patient.  As
this patient was noted to have a slightly prolonged QT
interval on EKG, it would also be useful to recheck an EKG
during this visit.  While this patient has had no complaints
of gastrointestinal bleed in the past, he should be sent for
endoscopy to look for varices as an outpatient.  The patient
has also been requesting psychiatric and/or social work
support as he has numerous psychosocial stressors and needs a
support network to help him with his depression and with the
numerous issues involving his drug abuse and health care
problems.  This patient should also be set up to be followed
in the HIV Clinic.
3.  The patient was also scheduled to visit the Pain Clinic
at [**Hospital1 75**] this Thursday with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10739**] on [**3-30**] at 12:40 p.m.  This visit is
important in light of his chronic back pain and peripheral
neuropathy, which the patient states have been a factor in
his persistent drug use.
4.  Continue with Methadone maintenance program as previous
to admission.
5.  Consider contacting [**Last Name (un) 10740**] for acupuncture treatments as
the patient has requested this therapy which has worked for
him in the past.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Opioid and benzodiazepine intoxication.
2.  Polysubstance abuse.
3.  HIV positive.
4.  Hepatitis C positive.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Depression.

     EXAMINATION:  MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium.
     
     INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with lung cancer and right intracranial bleed
     and history of brain metastases.  Please evaluate for acute infarct.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted images of the brain with gadolinium
     according to standard departmental protocol.  No prior study for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  On diffusion-weighted images there is a small area of restricted
     diffusion along the falx within the left occipitotemporal lobe.  It is also
     bright on FLAIR-weighted images and may represent a subacute infarct. Clinical
     correlation is recommended.  On gradient echo images there is a large area of
     intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right parietal lobe and left thalamus
     which following administration of gadolinium reveals ring-enhancing lesions.
     These are suspicious for hemorrhagic metastases given the patient's history.
     Additional ring-enhancing lesions throughout the supra- and infratentorial
     compartments are visualized.  There is a moderate amount of peritumoral edema
     involving the right parietal lobe lesion in addition to a second right
     parietal lesion along the falx high in the vertex.  The other areas of
     metastases reveal a minimal amount of peritumoral edema.

Foot Xrays [**3115-8-24**]:IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with 
osteomyelitis involving the proximal first, second, and likely 
the first tarsometatarsal joint. The base of the third 
metatarsal may also be involved 

pMIBI [**3115-8-26**]: IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal study with a 
large, reversible anterolateral wall defect and a moderate, 
reversible inferior wall defect. Severe global hypokinesis with 
a calculated EF of 22%. 

TTE [**3115-8-26**]: Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include 
moderate to severe inferior, septal, anterior, and apical 
hypokinesis. Mild (1+) Ao regurg is seen. Mild (1+) MR is seen. 
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired 
relaxation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. 

Polypectomy [**3115-9-10**]: 3.5cm polyp removed piecemeal using loop 
wire excision.  14cm from rectum

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted [**3115-8-23**] for above mentioned CC/HPI. Patient 
given angio on [**8-24**] that showed SFA and infrageniculate vessel 
disease.  On vascular work-up, cardiology was consulted for 
pre-operative clearance with pMIBI and TTE that were both 
positive for significant reversible anterolateral defects and a 
moderate, reversible inferior wall defect. Severe global 
hypokinesis with a calculated EF of 22%. While in pre-op holding 
for cardiac cath, patient had sudden, massive BRBPR.  Cath was 
canceled and when back on the floor, patient deteriorated and 
was hemodynamically unstable. He was transferred to the SICU, 
and GI was consulted.  Flex sig showed large sessile polyp 
(approx 4cm in diameter) that was possibly the site of bleeding. 
On colonoscopy, the actual area of bleeding was seen to be a 
rectal ulcer for which the patient was taken to the OR by 
general surgery on [**3115-8-29**] and the ulcer was oversewn.  On [**8-31**], 
patient was given cardiac cath, without stent placement, and on 
[**9-2**] patient had BPG performed from Right Fem to distal Anterior 
Tib artery with additional resection of right common femoral 
pseudoaneurysm with a Dacron patch angioplasty.  Patient 
tolerated procedure well with strong RLE pulses and re-perfusion 
edema and hyperemia.  Following vascular intervention, patient 
was taken off of his aspirin for five days, and GI completed 
patient's workup by removing a 3.5cm sessile polyp, 14cm from 
his rectum, in a piecemeal fashion. Patient d/c'ed to rehab 
center on HD 20 with f/u appointments for general surgery, 
vascular surgery, plastic surgery and GI.

Admission Date:  [**2976-11-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2976-11-29**]

Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M

Service:  Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old male with
a history of hypertension, stroke, dementia, and depression,
some previous abdominal surgery, who is under full-time care
of two caretakers, who noticed today that the patient was
lethargic, and unable to get out of bed along with being
aphasic.  This was noted at approximately 7 p.m.  The patient
was reportedly globally weak.  They also reported that his
eyes looked differently than they normally did.  No other
history was able to be obtained at that time.

Upon further contact with the patient's sister, it was
determined that the patient is under the full-time care of
his caretakers and after his stroke four years ago in [**2972**],
she suffered from severe dementia along with inability to
engage in activities of daily living.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. CVA.
3. DVT in [**2958**].
4. Abdominal hernia.
5. Dementia.
6. Depression.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Multiple abdominal surgeries for
ventral hernia and incisional hernias.

MEDICATIONS:  All antihypertensive medications.

ALLERGIES:  Reactions unknown.
1. Sulfa.
2. Amoxicillin.
3. Codeine.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile, pulse 70, blood pressure
240/109, systolic ranging from 162-270, respirations 16, and
O2 saturation is 100%.  Patient is alert and acknowledges the
examiner.  He speaks in short sentences.  He has no right
gaze in each eye.  He does have intact upward, downward, and
left gaze.  Questionable facial droop on the right.  He
follows commands in all four extremities.  His strength is
[**5-20**] bilateral upper and lower extremities in the grip,
biceps, triceps, iliopsoas, gastroc, and [**Last Name (un) **].  His reflexes
are 1+ in the biceps, triceps, and quads bilaterally.  His
toes are downgoing bilaterally.  Sensory examination was
unable to be obtained.  Fine finger movements are decreased
bilaterally.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 9.3,
hematocrit 54.1, platelets 183.  Coags were 13.2, 35.5, and
1.2.  Chemistry was sodium 137, potassium 5.1, chloride 100,
bicarb 20, BUN 24, creatinine 1.6, glucose 176.  Initial
cardiac enzymes were negative.

RADIOLOGIC EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Head CT shows a 4.5 x
4.5 cm cerebellar hemorrhage in the right cerebellar
hemisphere, the fourth ventricle is effaced with blood
tracking into it and into the third and lateral ventricles as
well.  There is periventricular edema indicating increased
ICP.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 75-year-old male with hypertension
now lethargic, aphasic with a left preferential gaze.  Now
with large cerebellar bleed and blood in the third and fourth
ventricles.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Trauma SICU.  Nipride drip was started.  Blood pressure was
monitored with an arterial line.  Blood pressures initially
were well controlled in the 130s systolic.  We then placed a
ventricular drain.  The patient prior to the ventricular
drain received 1 mg of midazolam and 1 mg of Morphine.  The
patient tolerated the ventricular drain placement well.
After the ventricular drain was placed, the patient was
neurologically unchanged.  The ICP at the time of ventricular
drain placement was approximately 8.  The patient remained
with stable vital signs until approximately one hour after
the drain was placed at which time his blood pressure
increased.  This increase was to the point, where the blood
pressure was in the low 200 systolic.

Nipride was pressed up and blood pressure was controlled down
into the high 170s.  The patient then became apneic.  His
systolic pressure dropped dramatically.  He became
unresponsive.  Neurologic examination at that time revealed
pupils were blown bilaterally.  Patient was unresponsive.  He
had no corneal or gag reflex.  Patient's blood pressure then
continued to drop and he became asystolic.

Time of death was 3:55 a.m.  The patient's sister was
contacted.  She did not wish to undergo autopsy.  The medical
examiner was contacted and he did not wish to go ahead with
examination.

MRI:On diffusion-weighted images there is a small area of 
restricted diffusion along the falx within the left 
occipitotemporal lobe. It is also bright on FLAIR-weighted 
images and may represent a subacute infarct. Clinical 
correlation is recommended. On gradient echo images there is a 
large area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right 
parietal lobe and left thalamus which following administration 
of gadolinium reveals ring-enhancing lesions. These are 
suspicious for hemorrhagic metastases given the patient's 
history. Additional ring-enhancing lesions throughout the supra- 
and infratentorial compartments are visualized. There is a 
moderate amount of peritumoral edema involving the right 
parietal lobe lesion in addition to a second right parietal 
lesion along the falx high in the vertex. The other areas of 
metastases reveal a minimal amount of peritumoral edema.
.
cxr: Cardiomegaly and mild CHF. Nasogastric tube as described 
above. Rounded opacity overlying the left hilum, which probably 
representing aspiration pneumonia; however, left hilar mass 
cannot be totally excluded. Please confirm resolution by 
repeated chest x-ray after treatment, and if the lesion 
persists, please evaluate by CT scan.
. 
ct: Stable appearance of right parietal lobe and left thalamic 
hemorrhages, which are concerning for hemorrhagic metastasis in 
this patient with known metastatic lung carcinoma to the brain.

 
Brief Hospital Course:

transferred to medicine, w/ pupillary assymmetry but no evidence 
of neglect, responding to commands.
.
1) altered MS- likely bleed into metastatic lesion, although 
unclear based on location of known lesions, vs component of 
fall.  as per NS, not a surgical candidate.  seems unlikely that 
pt will have dramatic cliical improvement given significant 
edema, mass lesions, and no NS intervention.

-cont dilantin px, particularly since pt has ? of witnessed sz 
event.
-cont high dose decadron, q6h w/ fs.
-will clarify 
.
2) GIB- drop in hct during admission and + NGL.  GI input 
appreciated felt likely [**1-24**] stress ulceration.  Enteral 
nutrition and PPI (usually oral) have been shown to reduce the 
risk of ongoing bleeding. 
-start TF's 10cc/h until nutrition recs
-IV protonix (given recent h/o GIB)
.
3) CAD/CHF- previously some CHF on CXR.  oxygenating well.

      HAS HAD ACTIVASE MANY TIMES, FLOW ONLY 150-200
      HAD RECENT GRAFT WHICH THROMBOSED,NEEDS NEW PERMACATH
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: 59-year-old male with end stage renal disease and on hemodialysis
     through a right internal jugular vein (IJ) tunneled catheter which showed poor
     flow in the last dialysis. Patient also had left arm arteriovenous graft
     placed in August which does not show thrill or pulsation.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1579**] [**Doctor Last Name **]
     d'Othee with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 7250**], the attending radiologist, being present in
     the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The risks, benefits were explained to the patient and
     informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the
     angiographic table and the right neck and the left arm were prepped and draped
     in sterile fashion. 1% Lidocaine was injected around the dialysis catheter
     exit site for local anesthesia.
     Contrast angiograms through both lumens of the catheter demonstrated extensive
     fibrin sheaths surrounding the catheter tip. Under fluoroscopic guidance,
     0.035 Amplatz wires were advanced through both lumens of the catheter
     respectively with the tip in the inferior vena cava. The catheter was removed.
     An 8 French [**Last Name (un) 534**]-Tip sheath was advanced over a wire with the tip in right
     lower internal jugular vein. Venogram by injection through the sidearm of the
     sheath again showed extensive filling defect in the right brachiocephalic vein
     and upper portion of the superior vena cava (SVC), consistent with fibrin
     sheath.
     Fibrin sheath venoplasty was performed with a 8 mm x 4 cm balloon first, and
     then a 14 mm x 4 cm balloon. Follow-up contrast venogram through the sheath
     demonstrated the flow tract in the right brachiocephalic vein and SVC is
     widely open, although, linear filling defects were still visualized but
     deviated to the right side of the vein.
     Subsequently a 14.5 French, double lumen, 24 cm-long (19 cn from cuff to tip)
     tunneled dialysis catheter was placed over the wire with the tip in the
     proximal right atrium. The catheter was flushed and locked with heparin
     solution. 0 Prolene stitches were used to secure the catheter to the skin.
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     
     Examination of the left upper arm AV graft revealed no thrill or pulsation.
     Using ultrasound guidance, the graft was accessed with a 21 gauge needle close
     to the arterial anastomosis pointing to the venous outflow. An 0.018 wire was
     advanced through the needle into the graft. The needle was exchanged for a
     small introducer of the micropuncture set.
     Fistulogram with injection of nonionic contrast was performed and demonstrated
     occlusion at the venous anastomosis and absence of opacification of a good-
     caliber venous outlow.
     The graft itself is partially opacified and partially occupied with filling
     defects suggestive of thrombosis.
     There was also a large filling defect in the brachial artery just below the
     arterial anastomosis, that seems to extend up to just above the bifurcation of
     the brachial artery. The brachial artery distal to the anastomosis is still
     patent but with faint opacification.
     After discussion with the referring surgeon (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7847**]), the procedure was
     stopped at this stage. The catheter sheath was removed and local hemostasis
     was achieved by manual compression.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Extensive fibrin sheath surrounding the distal portion of the right IJ
     access dialysis catheter treated with fibrin sheath venoplasty and replacement
     of the tunneled dialysis catheter.
     
     2. Occlusion of the left arm arteriovenous graft and venous anastomosis and
     partial obstruction of the brachial artery just downstream the arteriovenous
     anastomosis.

     HISTORY:  [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with a history of metastatic lung cancer to the
     brain.  Question hemorrhagic mass.  Question stability of bleed.
     
     COMPARISON:  Head CT from [**Hospital 12568**] Hospital dated [**2644-1-16**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior days study, there is stable appearance of the
     right parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema.  At the
     superior margin of the parenchymal hemorrhage there is a rounded heterogeneous
     focus which could represent a metastatic lesion.  An additional 2mm hyperdense
     focus, possibly hemorrhage, is noted in the posteromedial margin of the left
     thalamus, with surroundng edema.  Low-attenuation foci seen in both basal
     ganglia and insular regions are consistent with chronic lacunar infarcts.
     There is no shift of midline structures.  The ventricles are stable in
     appearance.  The osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of right parietal lobe and left thalamic
     hemorrhages, which are concerning for hemorrhagic metastasis in this patient
     with known metastatic lung carcinoma to the brain.

     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The risks, benefits were explained to the patient and
     informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the
     angiographic table and the right neck and the left arm were prepped and draped
     in sterile fashion. 1% Lidocaine was injected around the dialysis catheter
     exit site for local anesthesia.
     Contrast angiograms through both lumens of the catheter demonstrated extensive
     fibrin sheaths surrounding the catheter tip. Under fluoroscopic guidance,
     0.035 Amplatz wires were advanced through both lumens of the catheter
     respectively with the tip in the inferior vena cava. The catheter was removed.
     An 8 French [**Last Name (un) 534**]-Tip sheath was advanced over a wire with the tip in right
     lower internal jugular vein. Venogram by injection through the sidearm of the
     sheath again showed extensive filling defect in the right brachiocephalic vein
     and upper portion of the superior vena cava (SVC), consistent with fibrin
     sheath.
     Fibrin sheath venoplasty was performed with a 8 mm x 4 cm balloon first, and
     then a 14 mm x 4 cm balloon. Follow-up contrast venogram through the sheath
     demonstrated the flow tract in the right brachiocephalic vein and SVC is
     widely open, although, linear filling defects were still visualized but
     deviated to the right side of the vein.
     Subsequently a 14.5 French, double lumen, 24 cm-long (19 cn from cuff to tip)
     tunneled dialysis catheter was placed over the wire with the tip in the
     proximal right atrium. The catheter was flushed and locked with heparin
     solution. 0 Prolene stitches were used to secure the catheter to the skin.
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     
     Examination of the left upper arm AV graft revealed no thrill or pulsation.
     Using ultrasound guidance, the graft was accessed with a 21 gauge needle close
     to the arterial anastomosis pointing to the venous outflow. An 0.018 wire was
     advanced through the needle into the graft. The needle was exchanged for a
     small introducer of the micropuncture set.
     Fistulogram with injection of nonionic contrast was performed and demonstrated
     occlusion at the venous anastomosis and absence of opacification of a good-
     caliber venous outlow.
     The graft itself is partially opacified and partially occupied with filling
     defects suggestive of thrombosis.
     There was also a large filling defect in the brachial artery just below the
     arterial anastomosis, that seems to extend up to just above the bifurcation of
     the brachial artery. The brachial artery distal to the anastomosis is still
     patent but with faint opacification.
     After discussion with the referring surgeon (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7847**]), the procedure was
     stopped at this stage. The catheter sheath was removed and local hemostasis
     was achieved by manual compression.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Extensive fibrin sheath surrounding the distal portion of the right IJ
     access dialysis catheter treated with fibrin sheath venoplasty and replacement
     of the tunneled dialysis catheter.
     
     2. Occlusion of the left arm arteriovenous graft and venous anastomosis and
     partial obstruction of the brachial artery just downstream the arteriovenous
     anastomosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old woman with history of CAD, presents with AMS and 
sepsis, found to have MRSA urinary infection. 
.  
1) Urosepsis: Pt with fever, tachycardia, low BPs, and elevated 
lactate on admission and code sepsis was called. Resusitated 
with IVFs and placed on levophed x 1 day. Was subsequently 
weaned off of levophed with stable BPs during remaining hospital 
course.  Most likely source was UTI given positive UA and recent 
urinary tract infection. Pt has had e.coli and klebsiella in the 
past, both sensitive to fluoroquinolones. Pt received vanc/ctx 
in ED. In MICU, vancomycin d/c'd and was continued on levaquin. 
On transfer to floor, urine culture with MRSA, vancomycin 
restarted and levaquin d/c'd. PICC placed for outpt IV 
Vancomycin treatment for total of 14 days. Vancomycin trough 
level while in hospital therapeutic at 11.0.
.  
2) Cardiac: h/o CHF, CAD, HTN. Pt has tendence to get volume 
overloaded and symptomatic CHF when her diuretic +/- her ACE are 
held.  However, given low BP requiring pressors on admission, 
ACE-I, BB, and Lasix were held. Once BPs were more stable, all 
three were readded without event. ASA was also continued. 
.  
3) Acute Renal failure: Likely acute on chronic secondary to 
prerenal state. Pt's Cr peaked to 2.0 while in house, has since 
dropped back to baseline after IVFs. 
.
4) DM - Diet controlled as outpt. HISS with QID FS.
.
5) Anemia - baseline Hct in upper 20s low 30s. Iron studies were 
consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
.
6) s/p amputation of L 5th toe and R 3rd toe - Wound care 
continued. 
.
7) Access - PICC.
.
8) Communication - with pt's daughter [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1590**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] 
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 6479**]. 
.
9) Ppx - Heparin SQ. 
.
The pt was discharged to a rehab facility for PT/OT and to 
finish her 14 day course of IV Vancomycin for MRSA urinary 
infection.

     This is a portable semierect chest that is dated [**2644-1-19**] compared to
     [**2644-1-17**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Question aspiration pneumonia.
     
     Nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm.  The cardiac silhouette
     appears enlarged, but stable.  There is a large mass-like opacity overlying
     the left hilum, which has slightly lobulated margins.  This measures about 6
     cm in greatest diameter.  Bilateral pleural effusions are noted, moderate on
     the left and small on the right.  No pneumothorax is identified.
     
     As compared to the previous study, alveolar opacities adjacent to the
     perihilar mass have resolved.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Marked improvement in left perihilar alveolar process with residual
     well-marginated mass-like opacity, concerning for neoplasm.  This could be
     initially confirmed with PA and lateral chest radiographs, but CT may be
     considered for more complete characterization.  Findings communicated to

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6230**] 
Chief Complaint:
54 year-old male with an enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma, 
status post hyper CVAD therapy and 5 cycles of CHOP, and 
recently ICE chemotherapy and collection, being admitted for 
auto-BMT.
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy ([**3352-7-18**]) 
 
History of Present Illness:
54 year-old male with an enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma 
diagnosed in [**3349**], with known gastric and jejunal ulcers and 
history of small bowel resection for microperforation, admitted 
for auto-BMT on [**3352-6-23**]. He was previously treated with 
hyper-CVAD (did not tolerate) and 5 cycles of CHOP. His course 
was complicated by a bout of hepatitis in [**3352-4-25**] which was 
felt to be chemical in etiology and led to weight loss, sprue 
exacerbation and relapse. Following his bout of hepatitis, Mr. 
[**Known patient lastname 7791**] was started back on TPN and has been doing well on it. He 
was recently teated with a cycle of ICE chemotherapy and 
collected in preparation for auto-BMT. 

His bone marrow performed at the beginning of [**Female First Name (un) 493**] revealed some 
minimal involvement with his T-cell lymphoma. His liver biopsy 
performed on [**3352-5-4**] revealed numerous apoptotic hepatocytes, 
multiple small foci of sinusoidal mononuclear inflammation and 
enlarged Kupffer cells consistent with acute hepatitis. No 
neoplastic cells. Tissue EGD performed on [**3352-5-18**] showed some 
involvement by enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma in one 
biopsy section.   
 
Past Medical History:
1. Sprue:  Diagnosis [**9-26**], which was refractory to gluten-free 
diet at which point prednisone therapy was initiated.  Further 
investigation led to biopsy of small bowel and the diagnosis of 
T cell lymphoma was made.

2. T cell Lymphoma:  As per HPI.

3. Transaminitis:  From [**Date range (1) 7792**] (peak AST 198, ALT 247, alk 
phos 1062, negative HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV, CMV, toxo, VZV, HSV1, 
HSV2).  Thought to be secondary to chemo and/or TPN.  Liver bx 
revealed non-specific inflammation consistent with acute 
hepatitis.
 
Social History:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7791**] lives with his wife, a nurse. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7793**] 1 pack of 
cigarettes per day, denies alcohol or illicit drug use.   
 
Family History:
Mother with breast cancer. His father died of an unknown cardiac 
event at the age 34. Mother, sister and grandmother have 
diabetes mellitus.

[**3352-6-6**] CMV IgG and IgM negative

 
Brief Hospital Course:
His hospital course will be reviewed by problems:

1) Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma: He received Ara-C and 
Etoposide (day -6 to -3) and melphalan (day -2) as part of the 
BEAM protocol, followed by a rest day. Reinfusion was done on 
[**3352-6-30**], which was well tolerated. His period of neutropenia 
extended from [**3352-7-3**] to [**3352-7-13**], at which time his ANC was 
back up to 2230. He had evidence of only mild oropharyngeal 
mucositis which was treated with Peridex and Nystatin. 

On [**3352-7-21**], Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7791**] had an acute transfusion reaction to 
platelets, with hypotension, diffuse dermal edema and 
periorbital edema, currently under investigation. He received 
Solumedrol IV and Pepcid IV with symptomatic relief. 
Premedication changed to Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV, Benadryl 50 
mg IV, Pecid 20 mg IV, Tylenol 500-650 mg PO. 

2) ID: Mr [**Known patient lastname 7791**] had an isolated temperature spike on [**3352-6-27**] 
(day -3), at which time he was started on Vancomycin and 
Levoquin (latter to be started as part of the protocol on 
[**3352-6-28**]). He quickly defervesced, but developed a diffuse 
maculopapular rash on [**3352-6-29**], at which time Vanco was D/C'd as 
it was felt to be a possible culprit. Cultures from that time 
were negative. He became febrile again on [**3352-7-6**], at which 
time Vanco and Cefepime were started, and Levoquin was 
discontinued. He remained persistently febrile and an antifungal 
was added, along with Flagyl for a history of diarrhea 
(eventually C. difficile negative). His rash persisted, and 
decision was taken to D/C Cefepime (query contribution to 
persistent rash) and start Aztreonam. Given worsening of the 
rash with periorbital edema and query contribution to the fever, 
along with possibility of drug fever, all antibiotics were 
stopped on [**3352-7-12**] and he received 1 dose of Solumedrol. He 
defervesced for 24 hours, then his temperature rose again. He 
was restarted on Flagyl and Levo on [**3352-7-15**]. Ambisome was added 
on [**7-16**] secondary to a finding of pulmonary nodules on CT scan, 
however pulmonary did not feel these were significant, and 
ambisome was d/c'ed on [**7-22**] since the patient was not 
neutopenic. His temperature reached a peak to 104.6 on [**3352-7-16**]. 
CT chest on [**3352-7-16**] revealed multiple small non-specific 
nodules, felt by pulmonary to be non-significant. CT abdomen and 
pelvis negative on [**3352-7-16**]. Aztreonam was added to the regimen 
on [**7-17**]. ID was consulted, and antibiotics were changed to 
Meropenem and Flagyl, and continue Acyclovir. Daptomycin was 
added on [**3352-7-18**] given persistent fever and desire to broaden 
gram positive coverage (Vancomycin was felt to be a potential 
culprit in the rash). All cultures negative thus far except for 
a single bottle positive for Corynebacterium on [**3352-7-6**] felt to 
be a contaminant. An MRI of the liver done on [**3352-7-19**] was 
negative for hepatic candidiasis. Stool cultures were negative. 
Repeat CMV negative. He defervesced on the above regimen. His 
last temperature spike was on [**7-19**]. On [**7-24**] meropenem and 
flagyl were discontinued, with no further fever spikes.  He will 
be discharged on acyclovir, and nystatin swish and swallow.  

3) GI: On [**3352-7-14**], Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7791**] had a Hct drop from 27 to 21 with 
frankly guaiac positive stools. The source was felt most likely 
to be upper GI. He was seen by GI, who was reluctant to perform 
a scope given the patient's low platelets and leukopenia, 
although ANC > 500. Decision was taken to treat conservatively, 
with blood product support. On [**3352-7-17**], his Hct dropped again 
from 29 to 21.8 with persistent melanotic stools and he was 
transferred to the ICU. An EGD was performed on [**3352-7-18**], which 
revealed ulceration in D3 consistent with an area of ulcerative 
duodenitis without active bleeding. The EGD was otherwise normal 
to D2. Pill endoscopy was considered but cancelled given a prior 
history of small bowel stricture. The bleeding was also not 
significant enought for a tagged RBC scan. He received a total 
of 6 units PRBCs in the ICU, and 4 units of platelets. He was 
transferred back to the floor on [**3352-7-20**]. His Hct has remained 
stable since transfer, without further melena. Protonix IV 
changed to PO BID on [**3352-7-22**], which he will be discharged on. 

4) Rash: History as above in ID section. He developed a diffuse 
maculopapular rash on [**3352-6-29**], which changed to a diffuse 
blanching erythematous rash on [**3352-7-12**] and persisted. He also 
developped some periorbital edema on [**3352-7-12**] and received a 
dose of Solumedrol. Dermatology was consulted, with an 
impression of erythroderma. Levoquin, Cefepime and Vancomycin 
considered potential culprits and to be avoided. He was treated 
symptomatically with Triamcinolone, and the rash resolved.

5) FEN:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7791**] was given TPN while he was here, in addition 
to being encouraged to eat.  He will go home with TPN cycled 
over 10 hours at night, and encouraged to eat a gluten free 
diet.

     transplant. Assess line placement and check for pneumonia prior to initiating
     chemotherapy.
     
     COMPARISON: [**3352-6-6**].
     
     FINDINGS: AP portable chest radiograph demonstrates the left sided central
     venous catheter has been removed. There is a dual lumen Hickman catheter
     entering from the right with its tip in the distal SVC. There is no change in
     the position of this catheter. There are no pulmonary infiltrates or pleural
     effusions. There is an ovoid structure in the right lung presumably
     projectional difference from the patient's rib or summation of structures with
     scapular tip.
     
     IMPRESSION: No pneumonia. Unusual ovoid density in the right mid lung zone
     presumably due to summation of structures. Recommend attention to this area on
     followup radiographs.

     INDICATION:  Status-post SMH thrombectomy and vein patch, now with increasing
     oxygen requirement and possible ARDS, pneumonia, or occult abscess.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with
     Visipaque contrast.  75 cc of Visipaque contrast was used due to the patient's
     elevated creatine (creatinine 2.0).  Oral contrast was also given.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3363-11-15**], torso CT.
     
     CHEST CT W/IV CONTRAST:  There is a left chest wall pacemaker with leads
     unchanged in position.  A right subclavian central venous line is present with
     tip in the lower superior vena cava.  There is an endotracheal tube with tip
     at the proximal portion of the right main stem bronchus.  A nasogastric tube
     is present which is coiled in the stomach.  There are several small
     mediastinal lymph nodes which have increased in size in the interval.  This is
     a nonspecific finding.  There is normal opacification of the aorta.  The heart
     is enlarged.  There is no pericardial fluid.  The patient is status-post
     median sternotomy.  Coronary artery calcifications are present.
     
     There is a moderate-sized right pleural effusion, which has slightly decreased
     in size in the interval.  There is a small left pneumothorax.  A left chest
     tube is present with tip in the posterior thoracic space.  Diffuse ground
     glass opacities are present which have worsened in the left lung in the
     interval. There is again noted an irregular rounded parenchymal opacity in the
     right upper lobe which measures 1.5 cm in diameter.  The appearance is not
     significantly changed in the interval.  There is patchy collapse in the right
     lower lobe.  Collapse/consolidation is present in the left lower lobe.  A
     small left pleural effusion is present.
     
     ABDOMEN CT W/O IV CONTRAST:  The liver is unremarkable.  There is vicarious
     excretion of contrast in the gallbladder.  The pancreas is largely fatty-
     replaced.  The spleen is shunken.  There is a small amount of perisplenic
     fluid.  The amount of perisplenic fluid has decreased in the interval.  There
     is a small amount of ascites within the abdomen which has decreased from the
     prior study.  The appearance of the kidneys is unchanged.  The right and left
     kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically.  There are again noted
     cortical defects and multiple cysts within the kidneys, which are stable.
     There is no hydronephrosis.  Extensive aortic calcifications are present.  No
                                                                 (Over)

     loculated collections are present.  The stomach and small bowel are
     unremarkable.  There is passage of contrast only into the proximal jejunum.
     There is no bowel-wall thickening, and there is no dilatation.  No free air is
     present.  There are no retroperitoneal collections.
     
     PELVIS CT W/IV CONTRAST:  A small amount of fluid is seen layering within the
     pelvis.  The rectum is unremarkable.  There is a Foley within the collapsed
     bladder.  The distal ureters are unremarkable.
     
     The osseous structures are unchanged.  There is extensive subcutaneous fat
     stranding consistent with edema.
     
     IMPRESSION
     1.  Endotracheal tube malpositioned with tip in the right main stem bronchus.
     2.  Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left; the right pleural
     effusion is slightly decreased in size in the interval.
     3.  Diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities, left greater than right, with
     bilateral lower lobe collection/consolidation.  The left lung has worsened in
     appearance the interval, likely at least partially due to the malpositioned
     endotracheal tube.
     4.  Small left pneumothorax, slightly increased in size in the interval.
     5.  Decreased ascites.
     6.  No intraabdominal source of infection identified.

     opacity immediately overlying the catheter which runs along the lateral right
     upper hemithorax.  No definite pulmonary infiltrates or effusions.  The
     osseous structures are unremarkable.  The right internal jugular central
     venous catheter tip extends to the distal SVC.  No pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  There is a somewhat well-circumscribed but subtle opacity immediately
     adjacent to the external portion of the catheter overlying the right upper
     lobe.  This may be related to the catheter itself but it is difficult to
     exclude an underlying opacity in this region.  Correlation with physical exam
     recommended.

     Nonionic contrast was used secondary to the patient's debility.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3352-4-26**] torso CT.
     
     CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.  Several
     small, nonpathologically enlarged, mediastinal lymph nodes are present.  There
     is a right internal jugular central venous line with tip in the lower superior
     vena cava.  The heart and great vessels are unremarkable.  Multiple
     subcentimeter bilateral pulmonary nodules are present.  Two nodules in the
     right upper lobe are slightly more prominent than on the prior study.  No new
     nodules are identified.

     adrenal glands are unremarkable.  Several stable exophytic lesions are present
     within the left kidney.  The stomach is unremarkable.  There is no bowel wall
     thickening or dilatation.  The colon is unremarkable.  Multiple small
     mesenteric and peripancreatic lymph nodes are present and are stable in the
     interval.
     
     PELVIC CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  The distal ureters, bladder, rectum, prostate,
     and sigmoid colon are unremarkable.  There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.
     
     The osseous structures are diffusely demineralized.  No suspicious lytic or
     sclerotic lesions are present.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No abnormal fluid collection or pulmonary infiltrates to explain the
     patient's fever.
     
     2.  Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, several of which are slightly more
     prominent than on the prior study.  This may be due to technical differences
     in slice selection.  Attention on follow up studies is recommended.

     INDICATION:  Status-post SMH thrombectomy and vein patch, now with increasing
     oxygen requirement and possible ARDS, pneumonia, or occult abscess.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with
     Visipaque contrast.  75 cc of Visipaque contrast was used due to the patient's
     elevated creatine (creatinine 2.0).  Oral contrast was also given.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3363-11-15**], torso CT.
     
     CHEST CT W/IV CONTRAST:  There is a left chest wall pacemaker with leads
     unchanged in position.  A right subclavian central venous line is present with
     tip in the lower superior vena cava.  There is an endotracheal tube with tip
     at the proximal portion of the right main stem bronchus.  A nasogastric tube
     is present which is coiled in the stomach.  There are several small
     mediastinal lymph nodes which have increased in size in the interval.  This is
     a nonspecific finding.  There is normal opacification of the aorta.  The heart
     is enlarged.  There is no pericardial fluid.  The patient is status-post
     median sternotomy.  Coronary artery calcifications are present.
     
     There is a moderate-sized right pleural effusion, which has slightly decreased
     in size in the interval.  There is a small left pneumothorax.  A left chest
     tube is present with tip in the posterior thoracic space.  Diffuse ground
     glass opacities are present which have worsened in the left lung in the
     interval. There is again noted an irregular rounded parenchymal opacity in the
     right upper lobe which measures 1.5 cm in diameter.  The appearance is not
     significantly changed in the interval.  There is patchy collapse in the right
     lower lobe.  Collapse/consolidation is present in the left lower lobe.  A
     small left pleural effusion is present.
     
     ABDOMEN CT W/O IV CONTRAST:  The liver is unremarkable.  There is vicarious
     excretion of contrast in the gallbladder.  The pancreas is largely fatty-
     replaced.  The spleen is shunken.  There is a small amount of perisplenic
     fluid.  The amount of perisplenic fluid has decreased in the interval.  There
     is a small amount of ascites within the abdomen which has decreased from the
     prior study.  The appearance of the kidneys is unchanged.  The right and left
     kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically.  There are again noted
     cortical defects and multiple cysts within the kidneys, which are stable.
     There is no hydronephrosis.  Extensive aortic calcifications are present.  No
                                                                 (Over)

     loculated collections are present.  The stomach and small bowel are
     unremarkable.  There is passage of contrast only into the proximal jejunum.
     There is no bowel-wall thickening, and there is no dilatation.  No free air is
     present.  There are no retroperitoneal collections.
     
     PELVIS CT W/IV CONTRAST:  A small amount of fluid is seen layering within the
     pelvis.  The rectum is unremarkable.  There is a Foley within the collapsed
     bladder.  The distal ureters are unremarkable.
     
     The osseous structures are unchanged.  There is extensive subcutaneous fat
     stranding consistent with edema.
     
     IMPRESSION
     1.  Endotracheal tube malpositioned with tip in the right main stem bronchus.
     2.  Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left; the right pleural
     effusion is slightly decreased in size in the interval.
     3.  Diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities, left greater than right, with
     bilateral lower lobe collection/consolidation.  The left lung has worsened in
     appearance the interval, likely at least partially due to the malpositioned
     endotracheal tube.
     4.  Small left pneumothorax, slightly increased in size in the interval.
     5.  Decreased ascites.
     6.  No intraabdominal source of infection identified.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Neutropenic fever.  Status post multiple transfusions.
     
     Compared to [**3352-7-12**].
     
     A right internal jugular vascular remains in satisfactory position.  The heart
     size and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Focal opacity is
     present adjacent to the catheter at the level of the 4th anterior rib.  A
     similar opacity is seen to be present on prior films dating back to [**3352-6-3**], and is probably related to the external portion of the catheter.  The
     lungs otherwise demonstrate no focal areas of consolidation and no pleural
     effusions are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Focal opacity adjacent to external portion of right-sided
     vascular catheter, which is likely an external structure related to the
     catheter. However, given the history of fever and neutropenia, either
     additional oblique portable radiographs or a PA & lateral chest radiograph
     would be helpful to fully exclude an underlying lung abnormality in this
     region.

     INDICATION:  Status-post SMH thrombectomy and vein patch, now with increasing
     oxygen requirement and possible ARDS, pneumonia, or occult abscess.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with
     Visipaque contrast.  75 cc of Visipaque contrast was used due to the patient's
     elevated creatine (creatinine 2.0).  Oral contrast was also given.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3363-11-15**], torso CT.
     
     CHEST CT W/IV CONTRAST:  There is a left chest wall pacemaker with leads
     unchanged in position.  A right subclavian central venous line is present with
     tip in the lower superior vena cava.  There is an endotracheal tube with tip
     at the proximal portion of the right main stem bronchus.  A nasogastric tube
     is present which is coiled in the stomach.  There are several small
     mediastinal lymph nodes which have increased in size in the interval.  This is
     a nonspecific finding.  There is normal opacification of the aorta.  The heart
     is enlarged.  There is no pericardial fluid.  The patient is status-post
     median sternotomy.  Coronary artery calcifications are present.
     
     There is a moderate-sized right pleural effusion, which has slightly decreased
     in size in the interval.  There is a small left pneumothorax.  A left chest
     tube is present with tip in the posterior thoracic space.  Diffuse ground
     glass opacities are present which have worsened in the left lung in the
     interval. There is again noted an irregular rounded parenchymal opacity in the
     right upper lobe which measures 1.5 cm in diameter.  The appearance is not
     significantly changed in the interval.  There is patchy collapse in the right
     lower lobe.  Collapse/consolidation is present in the left lower lobe.  A
     small left pleural effusion is present.
     
     ABDOMEN CT W/O IV CONTRAST:  The liver is unremarkable.  There is vicarious
     excretion of contrast in the gallbladder.  The pancreas is largely fatty-
     replaced.  The spleen is shunken.  There is a small amount of perisplenic
     fluid.  The amount of perisplenic fluid has decreased in the interval.  There
     is a small amount of ascites within the abdomen which has decreased from the
     prior study.  The appearance of the kidneys is unchanged.  The right and left
     kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically.  There are again noted
     cortical defects and multiple cysts within the kidneys, which are stable.
     There is no hydronephrosis.  Extensive aortic calcifications are present.  No
                                                                 (Over)

     loculated collections are present.  The stomach and small bowel are
     unremarkable.  There is passage of contrast only into the proximal jejunum.
     There is no bowel-wall thickening, and there is no dilatation.  No free air is
     present.  There are no retroperitoneal collections.
     
     PELVIS CT W/IV CONTRAST:  A small amount of fluid is seen layering within the
     pelvis.  The rectum is unremarkable.  There is a Foley within the collapsed

     The osseous structures are unchanged.  There is extensive subcutaneous fat
     stranding consistent with edema.
     
     IMPRESSION
     1.  Endotracheal tube malpositioned with tip in the right main stem bronchus.
     2.  Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left; the right pleural
     effusion is slightly decreased in size in the interval.
     3.  Diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities, left greater than right, with
     bilateral lower lobe collection/consolidation.  The left lung has worsened in
     appearance the interval, likely at least partially due to the malpositioned
     endotracheal tube.
     4.  Small left pneumothorax, slightly increased in size in the interval.
     5.  Decreased ascites.
     6.  No intraabdominal source of infection identified.

     Compared to previous radiograph of 2 days earlier.
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Persistent fever.  Focal opacity on portable chest x-
     ray.
     
     Comparison is made to the recent portable chest radiograph of [**3352-7-18**],
     multiple prior radiographs dating back to [**3352-4-26**].  The heart size,
     mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and stable.  Again
     demonstrated is a focal, sharply marginated opacity adjacent to the external
     portion of the right internal jugular catheter at approximately the fourth
     anterior rib level.  Review of multiple prior films demostrates a similar
     opacity since the time of placement of the catheter and there is no visible
     opacity in this region within the lung on the lateral view. These findings
     favor that the observed opacity is related to the catheter. The lungs appear
     grossly clear.  No pleural effusions are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Focal opacity adjacent to catheter appears to be related to the
     catheter rather than due to a lung opacification.

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Failing bypass graft.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Right lower extremity arteriogram with cutting balloon angioplasty
     of the distal graft and distal anastomosis.  Completion arteriogram.
     
     SURGEON:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 503**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 984**]
     
     ASSISTANT:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2898**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2899**].
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Local with sedation.  Baseline creatinine is 1.3.  Fluoroscopy
     time is 25 minutes and we used 105 cc of full strength Visipaque.
     
     PROCEDURE  The patient was brought into the interventional suite and placed in
     a supine position.  After adequate sedation per nursing, he was prepped and
     draped in the normal sterile manner.   Retrograde left common femoral artery
     access was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall puncture needle, a 0.035
     starter wire, and a 4-French sheath.  The wire was easily advanced into the
     infrarenal aorta and over this wire was placed an Omniflush catheter. Using
     the Omniflush catheter in conjunction with the angle glidewire access to the
     contralateral or right external iliac artery was obtained.  The catheter was
     left in the right external iliac artery and runoff views of the entire right
     lower extremity from level groin to the level of the foot were obtained. Based
     on the diagnostic arteriogram, it was decided to proceed with angioplasty.  An
     angled glide catheter was then used in conjunction with an angled Glidewire to
     cannulate the bypass graft. The catheter was left in the bypass graft and the
     4-French sheath was changed over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 647**] wire for a 6 FR [**Last Name (un) 2900**] sheath which
                                                                 (Over)

     tip was placed in the bypass graft on the right side. An arteriogram was done
     which confirmed again there was a tight stenosis at the distal anastomosis.
     The 0.035 angled Glidewire was changed out for a 0.014 wire and the distal
     anastomosis and distal graft was angioplastied with a 2 x 15 cutting balloon.
     A completion arteriogram demonstrated that there was a residual stenosis and
     this region with angioplastied with a 2.5 x 15 cutting balloon.  Part of this
     balloon extended into the native anterior tibial artery and there appeared to
     be a dissection and for this  reason the native anterior tibial artery with
     angioplasty for a prolonged time with a 2 x 2  angioplasty balloon. Completion
     arteriogram demonstrated an excellent result.  After an ACT was checked and
     found to be less than 200, all catheters, wires and sheaths were removed and
     the access site was sealed with direct pressure.  The patient tolerated the
     procedure well and was taken to the postoperative anesthesia care unit in
     stable condition.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 984**] was present and scrubbed for the entire
     procedure and fluoroscopy was utilized.
     
     ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:  There is a widely patent right common femoral artery.
     There is a profunda with a stenosis at its origin.  There is a patent proximal
     SFA. There is a patent proximal bypass graft off the common femoral artery.
     However, the distal anastomosis has a focal 99% stenosis.  We see angioplasty
     of the stenotic region with a 2 x 15 balloon, however, there is still residual
     stenosis that is significant. We see angioplasty of the area with a 2.5 x 15
     cutting balloon and subsequently angioplasty of the native anterior tibial
     artery with a 2 x.2 angioplasty balloon with a prolonged inflation for a
     dissection.  Completion arteriogram demonstrates an excellent result with
     brisk forward flow.  No evidence of thrombosis or residual dissection.  The
     patient was taken to the postoperative anesthesia care unit with a briskly
     palpable bypass graft pulse.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Fifty-four year old man with T-cell lymphoma, s/p chemotherapy,  
     presenting for restaging. 
      
     METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18 
     fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
     correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
     are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
     overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
     level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 113 mg/dL. The area
     imaged spanned the region from the skull base to the upper femurs. 
       
     Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
     images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
     determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
     implications regarding the significance of that uptake.  
      
     FINDINGS:  No abnormal foci of FDG uptake are present.  Incidental note is made
     of uptake within the paraspinal musculature and within the neck muscles, which
     is physiologic.  
       
     Physiologic uptake is seen in the myocardium, the liver and the gastrointestinal
     tracer. 
       
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of FDG-avid disease.

     INDICATION:  T cell lymphoma, status post autologic bone marrow transplant,
     currently with neutropenic fever, evaluate for pulmonary infiltrates.
     
     FINDINGS:  PA & lateral view demonstrate the presence of a subclavian-approach
     right-sided double-lumen catheter terminating in a position overlying the SVC,
     some 4 cm below the carina and just above the expected entrance into the right
     atrium.  There is no pneumothorax or any other catheter-related complication.
     The heart size is within normal limits.  Thoracic aorta and mediastinal
     structures are unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No signs of
     acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present.  Ordinary thoracic
     khyposis on lateral view with normal-appearing vertebral bodies and free
     posterior pleural sinuses.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Double-lumen catheter in place, otherwise normal chest findings.  The next
     previous chest examination in the patient's record is dated [**3352-7-20**],

     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  No acute intracranial
     hemorrhage is identified.  There is no mass effect or shift of normally
     midline structures.  The lateral ventricles are symmetric and nondilated.  The
     [**Doctor Last Name **]-white differentiation is preserved.  The density values of the brain
     parenchyma are within normal limits.  Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of
     fracture.  The mastoid air cells and visualized portions of the paranasal
     sinuses are normally pneumatized.  There are multiple rounded lucencies within
     the cortex of the calvarium near the vertex.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.  No evidence of infarct.
     CT has limited sensitivity in the detection of early infarct.  If there is
     clinical suspicion, an MR of the brain with diffusion- weighted imaging is
     recommended.
     These findings were discussed with the intern caring for the patient at the
     time of image interpretation.
     
     2.  Multiple punctate lucencies within the cortex of the calvarium, of
     uncertain significance.

     performed through the circle of [**Location (un) **] and its major tributaries with
     multiplanar reformatted images for a brain MRA.
     
     BRAIN MR:  There are no areas of slowed diffusion to suggest an acute stroke.
     There are no areas of abnormal enhancement on the post-contrast weighted
     images.  There is no evidence of blood products on the gradient echo weighted
     images.  There is nonspecific hyperintensity in the periventricular white
     matter seen best on the FLAIR-weighted sequence.  This is also apparent on the

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  A 55-year-old man with history of B-cell lymphoma with recent
     hematocrit drop from 28 to 13, rule out acute bleed.
     
     COMPARISONS:  CT torso [**3353-1-11**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images of the abdomen and pelvis without IV contrast.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The lung bases are clear.  The
     visualized portion of the heart and pericardium is unremarkable.  The liver is
     unremarkable without focal lesions on this noncontrast study.  The previously
     described soft tissue mass located in the periportal region anterior to the
     pancreas is not optimally visualized on today's noncontrast study.  The
     gallbladder is unremarkable without stones.  Spleen is of normal size without
     focal lesions on this noncontrast study.  The kidneys appear normal without
     stones or hydronephrosis.  The pancreas is unremarkable.  There are several
     subcentimeter nodes within the mesentery, but none rising to the level of
     pathologic enlargement.  There is no free fluid or free air within the
     abdomen.  The stomach and intra-abdominal bowel is unremarkable.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is no evidence of retroperitoneal
     hemorrhage, fluid collection, or abscess.  The intrapelvic bowel is
     unremarkable.  The bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles appear normal.
     There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes within the deep pelvic and
     inguinal regions.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.  Again, seen
     are multiple hemangiomas throughout the vertebral bodies.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) No evidence of intra-abdominal or intrapelvic hematoma.
     2) The previously described soft tissue mass in the periportal region, is not
     well visualized and characterized on this noncontrast study.
     
     These results were verbalized by phone to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1663**] on [**3353-1-16**].

     ADDENDUM: The MR angiography was re-reviewed. The previously noted
     questionable prominence of the anterior communicating artery is most probably
     a tortuosity and not an aneurysm. If clinically warranted, an MR angiogram
     may be performed in 4-6 months to assess interval  change.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  55-year-old man with new onset right-sided facial weakness,
     evaluate for infarct, ischemia, or mass.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1- and T2-weighted images were performed through the brain.
     Diffusion-weighted images were also performed.  3D time-of-flight imaging was
     performed through the circle of [**Location (un) **] and its major tributaries with
     multiplanar reformatted images for a brain MRA.
     
     BRAIN MR:  There are no areas of slowed diffusion to suggest an acute stroke.
     There are no areas of abnormal enhancement on the post-contrast weighted
     images.  There is no evidence of blood products on the gradient echo weighted
     images.  There is nonspecific hyperintensity in the periventricular white
     matter seen best on the FLAIR-weighted sequence.  This is also apparent on the
     T2-weighted images.
     
     There is no shift of normally midline structures.  The ventricles are not
     dilated.
     
     BRAIN MRA:  The vertebral arteries, anterior/inferior cerebellar arteries,
     superior cerebellar arteries, posterior cerebellar arteries, posterior
     communicating arteries, middle cerebral arteries, anterior cerebral arteries,
     and internal carotid arteries are seen and appear normal.  There is a small,
     1.0 mm prominence off the anterior communicating artery that could represent
     a tiny aneurysm vs. tortuosity of the vessel.  No significant areas of
     stenoses are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION
     1.  No evidence of acute stroke.
     2.  Nonspecific T2 hyperintensity in the periventricular white matter of the
     parietal lobes.
     3.  A 1.0 mm prominence of the anterior communicating artery which could
     represent a tortuosity of a vessel, however, a tiny aneurysm in this site
     cannot be excluded.  No other areas suspicious for aneurysmal dilatation are
     identified.

      55 year old man with enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Evaluate for leptomeningeal enhancement.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  This is a 55 year old man with history of sprue and a T-cell
     lymphoma of the small bowel.  Assess for leptomeningeal enhancement.  Recent
     bone marrow biopsy revealed findings suspicious for T-cell lymphoma throughout
     the marrow.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, T2, STIR, and axial T1, T2, T1 post contrast and
     sagittal T1 weighted images post gadolinium contrast administration were
     obtained.  There are no prior spine MRI's for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  The cervicomedullary junction is within normal limits.  There is no
     abnormal signal in or enhancement of the cervical spinal cord.  There is no
     evidence of meningeal enhancement or cervical spinal cord compression.  The
     marrow signal of the cervical vertebra is diffusely increased on the STIR
     images.  There is also mild diffuse enhancement of the marrow cavities of the
     cervical vertebra.  Our differential for these findings is serous atrophy of
     the marrow cavities versus diffuse infiltration by lymphoma.  The signal
     characteristics and enhancement characteristics are very uniform throughout
     the cervical marrow cavities.
     
     The paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1, T2, STIR, axial T2, and sagittal and axial T1
     weighted images post gadolinium contrast administration were obtained of the
     thoracic spine.  There are no prior spine MRI's for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no abnormal signal in the thoracic spinal cord.  There is
     no abnormal enhancement in or compression of the thoracic spinal cord.  Again,
     the marrow signal in the thoracic vertebra is diffusely increased on the STIR
     images.  This abnormality may be due to serous atrophy versus diffuse
     infiltration by lymphoma.  There is also diffuse subtle enhancement throughout
     the marrow cavities in the thoracic spine as well.  There is no evidence of a
     compression deformity in the thoracic spine.  The paraspinal soft tissues are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Diffuse increased signal in the marrow cavities of the thoracic
     vertebra on the STIR images with associated mild diffuse enhancement on the
     post contrast images.  Our differential diagnosis for this finding is serous
     atrophy versus diffuse infiltration via lymphoma.

     administration, and axial T1, T2, and T1 weighted images post gadolinium
     contrast administration were obtained of the lumbar spine.  There are no prior
     spine MRI's for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  The tip of the conus medullaris terminates in the normal position
     at the inferior endplate of L1.  There is no evidence of compression of the
     conus medullaris or cauda equina.  There is no abnormal enhancement of the
     cauda equina on the post contrast images.  Again, there is diffuse increased
     signal in the lumbar vertebra on the STIR images.  In the posterior aspect of
     L4 vertebral body, there is an area of decreased signal which may represent
     some residual normal fatty marrow.  The other marrow cavities decrease
     increased signal on the STIR images and mild diffuse enhancement on the post
     contrast images.  Again, we are suspicious of either serous atrophy versus
     diffuse infiltration by lymphoma.  There is a small right paracentral disc
     protrusion of a degenerated L5-S1 intervertebral disc.
     
     The paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.

     CHEST CT W/IV CONTRAST:  There is a left chest wall pacemaker with leads
     unchanged in position.  A right subclavian central venous line is present with
     tip in the lower superior vena cava.  There is an endotracheal tube with tip
     at the proximal portion of the right main stem bronchus.  A nasogastric tube
     is present which is coiled in the stomach.  There are several small
     mediastinal lymph nodes which have increased in size in the interval.  This is
     a nonspecific finding.  There is normal opacification of the aorta.  The heart
     is enlarged.  There is no pericardial fluid.  The patient is status-post
     median sternotomy.  Coronary artery calcifications are present.
     
     There is a moderate-sized right pleural effusion, which has slightly decreased
     in size in the interval.  There is a small left pneumothorax.  A left chest
     tube is present with tip in the posterior thoracic space.  Diffuse ground
     glass opacities are present which have worsened in the left lung in the
     interval. There is again noted an irregular rounded parenchymal opacity in the

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      55 year old man with enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Evaluate for leptomeningeal enhancement.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  This is a 55 year old man with history of sprue and a T-cell
     lymphoma of the small bowel.  Assess for leptomeningeal enhancement.  Recent
     bone marrow biopsy revealed findings suspicious for T-cell lymphoma throughout
     the marrow.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, T2, STIR, and axial T1, T2, T1 post contrast and
     sagittal T1 weighted images post gadolinium contrast administration were
     obtained.  There are no prior spine MRI's for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  The cervicomedullary junction is within normal limits.  There is no
     abnormal signal in or enhancement of the cervical spinal cord.  There is no
     evidence of meningeal enhancement or cervical spinal cord compression.  The
     marrow signal of the cervical vertebra is diffusely increased on the STIR
     images.  There is also mild diffuse enhancement of the marrow cavities of the
     cervical vertebra.  Our differential for these findings is serous atrophy of
     the marrow cavities versus diffuse infiltration by lymphoma.  The signal
     characteristics and enhancement characteristics are very uniform throughout
     the cervical marrow cavities.
     
     The paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1, T2, STIR, axial T2, and sagittal and axial T1
     weighted images post gadolinium contrast administration were obtained of the
     thoracic spine.  There are no prior spine MRI's for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no abnormal signal in the thoracic spinal cord.  There is
     no abnormal enhancement in or compression of the thoracic spinal cord.  Again,
     the marrow signal in the thoracic vertebra is diffusely increased on the STIR
     images.  This abnormality may be due to serous atrophy versus diffuse
     infiltration by lymphoma.  There is also diffuse subtle enhancement throughout
     the marrow cavities in the thoracic spine as well.  There is no evidence of a
     compression deformity in the thoracic spine.  The paraspinal soft tissues are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Diffuse increased signal in the marrow cavities of the thoracic
     vertebra on the STIR images with associated mild diffuse enhancement on the
     post contrast images.  Our differential diagnosis for this finding is serous
     atrophy versus diffuse infiltration via lymphoma.

     administration, and axial T1, T2, and T1 weighted images post gadolinium
     contrast administration were obtained of the lumbar spine.  There are no prior
     spine MRI's for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  The tip of the conus medullaris terminates in the normal position
     at the inferior endplate of L1.  There is no evidence of compression of the
     conus medullaris or cauda equina.  There is no abnormal enhancement of the
     cauda equina on the post contrast images.  Again, there is diffuse increased
     signal in the lumbar vertebra on the STIR images.  In the posterior aspect of
     L4 vertebral body, there is an area of decreased signal which may represent
     some residual normal fatty marrow.  The other marrow cavities decrease
     increased signal on the STIR images and mild diffuse enhancement on the post
     contrast images.  Again, we are suspicious of either serous atrophy versus
     diffuse infiltration by lymphoma.  There is a small right paracentral disc
     protrusion of a degenerated L5-S1 intervertebral disc.
     
     The paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Diffuse increased signal in the marrow cavities on the STIR

     INDICATION:  55-year-old male with T-cell lymphoma and neutropenia with
     fevers.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the Chest performed after the intravenous administration of
     100 mL of Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was used due to patient debility.
     Comparison is made to a PET CT of [**3352-9-21**] and a CT of the torso from
     [**3352-4-26**].
     
     CT of the chest with contrast:  No pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar, or
     mediastinal nodes are seen.  The heart, pericardium, great vessels are within
     normal limits.
     
     There is mild diffuse centrilobular emphysema.  Calcified granulomas are seen
     within the left lower lobe (series 3 image 35) as well as within the lingula
     (series 3 image 38) and within the left apex (series 3, image 7).  Tiny 2-3 mm
     noncalcified pulmonary nodules are seen within the right upper lobe (series 3
     images 13, 21, and 35.  These calcified granulomas and noncalcified pulmonary
     nodules were present on the prior CT from [**3352-4-26**] and are unchanged.  No
     new pulmonary nodules or areas of pulmonary parenchymal consolidation are
     identified.  Pleural effusion is seen.  Airways are patent to the level of the
     subsegmental bronchi bilaterally.
     
     Within the visualized portions of the abdomen, limited views of the spleen,
     liver, and pancreas are normal.  An incompletely imaged low attenuation
     structure adjacent to the medial left kidney is seen.  Please note that an
     exophytic simple cyst was described on the left kidney on a CT
     from [**3352-4-26**].
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  No findings to suggest acute active pulmonary disease.
     
     2)  Multiple calcified granulomas and punctate noncalcified pulmonary nodules
     within both lungs are unchanged compared to [**3352-4-26**].
     
     3)  Low attenuation lesion along the medial aspect of the left kidney likely
     representing a simple cyst.  These findings are better evaluated on prior
     abdominal CTs.

     HISTORY:  This is a 55-year-old man with T-cell lymphoma.  Needs PICC line
     reposition.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 687**] [**Name (STitle) 688**] and Dr.
     [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1655**] [**Name (STitle) 343**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 343**], the attending radiologist supervised the entire
     procedure.
     
     The patient was placed on the angiography table.  The left arm was prepared in
     a sterile fashion.  The patient presented with an indwelling PICC line placed
     at bedside with malpositioned tip shown on previous chest x-ray.  Fluoroscopy
     was used and showed the tip in the left brachiocephalic vein.  Under
     fluoroscopic guidance, the line was advanced further into the superior vena
     cava.  The line was flushed and secured to the skin with a Stat-Lock.  A chest
     x-ray was obtained documenting adequate tip position in the superior vena
     cava.  The line is ready for use.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  There were no complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful reposition of double-lumen left-sided PICC line.

     HISTORY:  This is a 55-year-old man with T-cell lymphoma.  Needs PICC line
     reposition.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 687**] [**Name (STitle) 688**] and Dr.
     [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1655**] [**Name (STitle) 343**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 343**], the attending radiologist supervised the entire
     procedure.
     
     The patient was placed on the angiography table.  The left arm was prepared in
     a sterile fashion.  The patient presented with an indwelling PICC line placed
     at bedside with malpositioned tip shown on previous chest x-ray.  Fluoroscopy
     was used and showed the tip in the left brachiocephalic vein.  Under
     fluoroscopic guidance, the line was advanced further into the superior vena
     cava.  The line was flushed and secured to the skin with a Stat-Lock.  A chest
     x-ray was obtained documenting adequate tip position in the superior vena
     cava.  The line is ready for use.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  There were no complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful reposition of double-lumen left-sided PICC line.

     STUDY:  CT torso.
     
     INDICATION:  59-year-old female with a history of metastatic renal cell
     cancer, presenting with worsening dyspnea and cough.
     
     COMPARISONS:  [**2745-5-21**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast MDCT axial images of the abdomen were acquired.
     Following the administration of 100 cc of Optiray 350 intravenous contrast,
     MDCT axial images were acquired from the thoracic inlet to the pubic
     symphysis.  Three-minute axial delayed images were acquired through the
     kidneys.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were then obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There has been a slight interval
     progression in the multiple pulmonary metastatic lesions.  A right upper
     paratracheal lymph node now measures 6.4 x 5.8 cm which is not significantly
     changed from the previous measurements of 7.2 x 6.1 cm (series 3, image 19).
     There has been interval increase in right upper lobe collapse.  Aside from
     multiple pulmonary metastases, the lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart and
     great vessels are unremarkable.  There is no pericardial effusion.  There are
     no pleural effusions.
     
     On today's examination of the anterior branch of the left upper lobe segmental
     bronchus appears to be compressed by the left hilar mass which is new compared
     to the examination of [**2745-5-21**]. The apical and posterior branches are patent.
     Both the lingular, left lower lobe, and right main stem bronchi are noted to
     be extrinsically narrowed by the hilar lymphadenopathy.  The airways are
     otherwise patent to the segmental level.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  A hypodense lesion within the right lobe
     of the liver on today's examination measures 16 x 14 mm which is smaller
     compared to the previous measurements of 19 x 18 mm (series 3, image 55).  No
     new lesions are identified throughout the liver.  There is no intra- or extra-
     hepatic biliary dilatation.  The gallbladder is noted to be mildly distended.
     A hypodense lesion within the right kidney, interpolar region, measuring 1.2
     cm in diameter is unchanged compared to the previous examination (series 3,
     image 78).  The patient is status post left nephrectomy and left
     adrenalectomy.  There is no evidence of recurrence of tumor within the
     resection bed.  There is a new focus of hypodensity within the lateral aspect

     and abdominal portions of the large and small bowel appear within normal
     limits.  There is no abdominal fluid or free air.  No mesenteric or
     retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is present.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  A complex left cystic adnexal mass on
     today's examination measures 2.9 x 2.4 cm which is approximately unchanged
     compared to the previous examination (series 3, image 103).  A calcified
     fibroid uterus is again noted.  The bladder is unremarkable.  The rectum and
     sigmoid colon appear within normal limits.  There is no free fluid within the
     pelvis.  No pathologic pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes are noted.

     TECHNIQUE:  Post-contrast images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to the
     pubic symphysis.
     
     CONTRAST:  150 mL of Optiray was administered.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is no significant axillary,
     mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  The heart and great vessels are
     unremarkable.  Multiple 2 mm, noncalcified nodules are present throughout the
     lungs.  These are stable compared with the prior studies.  No new pulmonary
     nodules are detected.  There are no pleural effusions.  The airways are
     patent.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, spleen,
     pancreas, adrenal glands, small and large bowel are unremarkable.  A rounded
     hypodense lesion extends from the upper pole of the left kidney.  There is a
     smaller hypodense lesion extending from the lower pole of the left kidney.
     These likely represent simple renal cysts.  The remainder of the kidneys
     appear unremarkable.  The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete normally.
     There is no hydronephrosis. There is no abdominal adenopathy.  Atherosclerotic
     plaque is noted along the abdominal aorta.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is complete occlusion of
     the proximal portions of the iliac vessels bilaterally.  Both vessels
     demonstrate reconstitution proximal to the level of the common femoral

     TECHNIQUE:  Post-contrast images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to the
     pubic symphysis.
     
     CONTRAST:  150 mL of Optiray was administered.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is no significant axillary,
     mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  The heart and great vessels are
     unremarkable.  Multiple 2 mm, noncalcified nodules are present throughout the
     lungs.  These are stable compared with the prior studies.  No new pulmonary
     nodules are detected.  There are no pleural effusions.  The airways are
     patent.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, spleen,
     pancreas, adrenal glands, small and large bowel are unremarkable.  A rounded
     hypodense lesion extends from the upper pole of the left kidney.  There is a
     smaller hypodense lesion extending from the lower pole of the left kidney.
     These likely represent simple renal cysts.  The remainder of the kidneys
     appear unremarkable.  The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete normally.
     There is no hydronephrosis. There is no abdominal adenopathy.  Atherosclerotic
     plaque is noted along the abdominal aorta.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is complete occlusion of
     the proximal portions of the iliac vessels bilaterally.  Both vessels
     demonstrate reconstitution proximal to the level of the common femoral
     arteries.  The occluded segment of the right iliac artery is less than 1cm.

     recurrence.
     
     COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to [**3352-12-18**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with oral and IV contrast.
     Nonionic IV contrast was used due to patient's request.
     
     CT of the chest with IV contrast:  There is no significant axillary,
     mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  The heart and great vessels are
     unremarkable.  There are again noted multiple 2-mm noncalcified nodules
     throughout the lungs.  These nodules are stable when compared to the prior
     studies.  There are no new pulmonary nodules seen.  There are no pleural
     effusions.  The airways are patent.
     
     CT of the abdomen with oral and IV contrast:  There is a new soft tissue mass
     located in the periportal region, anteriorly to the pancreas (series 2, image
     62) that measures 2.0 x 1.8 cm.  This was not seen in the prior studies and
     most likely represents a peripancreatic lymph node.  This is concerning for
     lymphoma recurrence.  A PET/CT scan could be performed for further evaluation.
     
     Theliver is unremarkable.  There are no focal masses.  The portal vein,
     hepatic veins and hepatic artery are patent.  The spleen measures 14 cm and is
     borderline in size.  The adrenal glands are unremarkable.  There is again
     noted exophytic simple cysts in the left kidney that are unchanged when
     compared to prior studies.  The small and large bowel are unchanged.
     
     CT of the pelvis with oral and IV contrast:  There is again noted occlusion of
     the proximal portions of the iliac vessels bilaterally.  Both vessels
     demonstrate reconstitution of the common femoral arteries.  This finding is
     unchanged when compared to the prior study.  The urinary bladder, rectum are
     unremarkable.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.

     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with oral and IV contrast.
     Nonionic IV contrast was used due to patient's request.
     
     CT of the chest with IV contrast:  There is no significant axillary,
     mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  The heart and great vessels are
     unremarkable.  There are again noted multiple 2-mm noncalcified nodules

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  89-year-old woman with altered mental status and fevers with
     leukocytosis on multiple antibiotics.  History of right upper quadrant
     abdominal pain.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis [**3380-11-5**].
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Subsegmental atelectasis is seen in both
     lung bases with adjacent small bilateral pleural effusions.  The visualized
     aorta is heavily calcified and ectatic.  The visualized heart demonstrates
     coronary artery calcifications.  There is cardiomegaly.
     
     Evaluation of the abdominal organs is somewhat limited secondary to artifact
     from the patient's arm.  However, again seen in the posterior aspect of the
     right lobe of the liver is a 1-cm rounded low-density focus which most likely
     represents a simple liver cyst.  No other focal liver lesions or biliary
     ductal dilatation is identified.  The gallbladder is distended, but there is
     no gallbladder wall edema or gallstones to suggest cholecystitis.  Again seen
     within the body of the pancreas (series 2, image 27) is a 11-mm low-density
     cystic structure which is stable since the recent prior examination.  The
     remainder of the pancreas is unremarkable and there is no pancreatic ductal
     dilatation.  The spleen is normal in appearance.  Again seen throughout the
     bilateral kidneys are multiple rounded low-density foci, many of which are too
     small to characterize.  Two large hypodense lesions are seen in the left
     kidney measuring up to 4.5 cm.  The majority of these are too small to
     characterize but the large foci are consistent with simple renal cysts.  There
     is no evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter.  The cortex of the kidney
     enhances normally and symmetrically.  The stomach and intra-abdominal loops of
     small and large bowel are normal in appearance and caliber.  There is no
     evidence of free air or free fluid.  There is no pathologically enlarged
     mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The sigmoid colon demonstrates diverticulosis
     without diverticulitis.  The rectum and intrapelvic loops of small bowel are
     unremarkable. The bladder is collapsed around Foley catheter but is otherwise
     unremarkable. The patient is status post hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-
     oophorectomy. There is no pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic
     lymphadenopathy.  There is no free fluid.  There is a 5.2 x 2.4 cm rounded
     fat-containing inguinal hernia.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     The visualized aorta is normal in caliber throughout the abdomen but
     atherosclerotic calcifications are seen at the origin of the renal arteries,
     celiac axis, and SMA.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions,
     however, again seen is vertebral body height loss at T10 which is stable in
     appearance.
     
     CT REFORMATS:  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the axial
     findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No definite evidence of intra-abdominal infectious process.  Distended
     gallbladder without evidence for gallstones or gallbladder wall edema to
     suggest cholecystitis.  If clinically indicated a gallbladder ultrasound could
     be performed for definitive evaluation
     2.  Cystic lesion within the pancreas.  This could be definitively evaluated
     with CTA of the pancreas when the patient's clinical condition improves. There
     has been no change in the short interval since the last study.
     3.  Multiple low-density foci within the kidneys, the larger ones representing
     simple renal cysts.  The smaller ones are too small to characterize.
     4. Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications of the abdominal aorta and its
     branches.
     5. Small hypodensity within the liver dome which is too small to characterize.
     6.  Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine including vertebral body height
     loss at T10, which may represent an old compression fracture, unchanged.

     INDICATIONS:  T-cell lymphoma.  Neutropenia.  Tachycardia, tachypnea,
     respiratory alkalosis.  Evaluate for pulmonary embolism.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images of the chest were acquired before and after
     administration of 100 mL of Optiray IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
     reformatted images were made.
     
     COMPARISON:  Torso CT scan from [**3353-1-21**].
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Pulmonary vasculature is well
     opacified and demonstrates no intraluminal filling defects suggestive of
     pulmonary emboli.  There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.  There are
     no pathologically enlarged axillary or mediastinal lymph nodes.  No enlarged
     left hilar nodes are seen.  Multiple prominent right hilar nodes are present,
     but none of which meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement in size.  The
     appearance is unchanged compared to the prior study.
     
     Evaluation of lung windows shows a new patchy area of consolidation within the
     lingula. There is a suggestion of faint bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacity
     compared to the prior study.  Small nodules in the right lower lobe and left
     apex are unchanged.
     
     The osseous structures are unchanged.  Limited assessment of upper abdominal
     structures is unchanged since the prior torso CT scan.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images show no pulmonary
     emboli.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  No pulmonary embolus.
     2)  New patchy area of consolidation within the anterior lingula.  Findings

     INDICATIONS:  T-cell lymphoma.  Neutropenia.  Tachycardia, tachypnea,
     respiratory alkalosis.  Evaluate for pulmonary embolism.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images of the chest were acquired before and after
     administration of 100 mL of Optiray IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
     reformatted images were made.
     
     COMPARISON:  Torso CT scan from [**3353-1-21**].
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Pulmonary vasculature is well
     opacified and demonstrates no intraluminal filling defects suggestive of
     pulmonary emboli.  There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.  There are
     no pathologically enlarged axillary or mediastinal lymph nodes.  No enlarged
     left hilar nodes are seen.  Multiple prominent right hilar nodes are present,
     but none of which meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement in size.  The
     appearance is unchanged compared to the prior study.
     
     Evaluation of lung windows shows a new patchy area of consolidation within the
     lingula. There is a suggestion of faint bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacity
     compared to the prior study.  Small nodules in the right lower lobe and left
     apex are unchanged.
     
     The osseous structures are unchanged.  Limited assessment of upper abdominal
     structures is unchanged since the prior torso CT scan.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images show no pulmonary
     emboli.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  No pulmonary embolus.
     2)  New patchy area of consolidation within the anterior lingula.  Findings

     COMPARISONS:  CT torso [**3353-1-11**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images of the abdomen and pelvis without IV contrast.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The lung bases are clear.  The
     visualized portion of the heart and pericardium is unremarkable.  The liver is
     unremarkable without focal lesions on this noncontrast study.  The previously
     described soft tissue mass located in the periportal region anterior to the
     pancreas is not optimally visualized on today's noncontrast study.  The
     gallbladder is unremarkable without stones.  Spleen is of normal size without
     focal lesions on this noncontrast study.  The kidneys appear normal without
     stones or hydronephrosis.  The pancreas is unremarkable.  There are several
     subcentimeter nodes within the mesentery, but none rising to the level of
     pathologic enlargement.  There is no free fluid or free air within the
     abdomen.  The stomach and intra-abdominal bowel is unremarkable.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is no evidence of retroperitoneal
     hemorrhage, fluid collection, or abscess.  The intrapelvic bowel is
     unremarkable.  The bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles appear normal.
     There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes within the deep pelvic and
     inguinal regions.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.  Again, seen
     are multiple hemangiomas throughout the vertebral bodies.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) No evidence of intra-abdominal or intrapelvic hematoma.

     Reason: LYMPHOMA, RESTAGING.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Lymphoma, restaging.  H/o celiac sprue and enteropathy associated 
     lymphoma with new tissue mass seen in porta hepatis on recent CT torso. 
     
     METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18  
     fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
     correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
     are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
     overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
     level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 131 mg/dL. The area
     imaged spanned the region from the base of the skull to the proximal femurs.
      
     Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
     images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
     determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
     implications regarding the significance of that uptake. 
     
     COMPARISON:  PET CT from [**3352-9-21**], CT torso from [**3353-1-11**], chest CT from [**3353-1-15**].
     
     INTERPRETATION:  An FDG-avid right adrenal mass is identified measuring
     approximately 2.3 x 1.1 cm, with a maximal SUV value of 13.9.  In retrospect,
     this right adrenal lesion was seen on the prior CT scans dating back to [**3352-12-18**].
      Additionally, there is mildly increased FDG activity demonstrated within the
     medial limb of the left adrenal gland with a small nodule seen measuring
     approximately 1.7 x 1.0 cm.  The maximal SUV value for this left adrenal lesion
     is 3.0.
     
     Additionally, there has been interval development of new foci of abnormally
     increased FDG activity within the osseous structures including the right 1st
     rib, anterolateral portion of the right 2nd rib, posterior right 8th rib,
     posterior aspect of the right 10th rib, the left scapula, medial aspect of the
     left clavicle, and the T7 and L4 vertebral bodies.
      
     Physiologic FDG uptake is seen in the myocardium, liver and gastrointestinal
     tract.
      
     CT imaging findings include an ill-defined area of ground-glass opacity and
     nodule within the lingula, not significantly changed since the prior chest CT. 
     There is no associated FDG avidity with this lesion.  Multiple tiny
     subcentimeter pulmonary nodules are seen within both lungs, unchanged since the
     prior examinations, and too small to characterize on the PET scan.  Previously
     identified porta hepatis soft tissue lesion on the CT torso examination is not
     identified on the current noncontrast study.  No abnormal FDG activity is
     demonstrated within the region of the porta hepatis.  Stable left anterior iliac
     lesion is seen with a sclerotic rim, which does not demonstrate any abnormal
     FDG activity. 
     
     IMPRESSION:  1) New, FDG-avid, bilateral adrenal lesions, right greater than
     left, as well as multiple abnormal foci of increased FDG activity within the
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  55-year-old man with T cell lymphoma status post bone marrow
     transplant, now with neutropenic fevers.
     
     SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST dated [**3353-1-26**], is compared with single AP
     view of the chest dated [**3353-1-22**].  There is a new, subtle right lower
     lobe density, which appears to spread along the bronchovascular bundle with an
     adjacent peripheral opacity in the costophrenic angle.  This finding is
     worrisome for infection, especially aspergillus, in this neutropenic patient.
     A chest CT is recommended to further characterize the nature of this opacity.
     No other focal opacities are seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The left
     costophrenic angle is clear.  Again seen is the right PICC line terminating in
     the mid SVC.  The heart and mediasdtinal contours are normal and unchanged.
     The bones are osteopenic.
     
     IMPRESSION:  New right lower lobe opacity with more focal peripheral opacity
     in the right costophrenic angle, suspicious for infection, especially
     aspergillus, in this neutropenic patient. CT may be helpful for confirmation
     and further characterization. These findings were discussed at the conclusion
     of the examination with the physician covering for [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1669**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1670**] [**Doctor First Name 1671**]

     tachycardic and tachypneic with respiratory alkalosis, please evaluate new
     right lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray and rule out empyema.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT of the chest dated [**3353-1-15**], and PET CT dated
     [**3353-1-17**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained through the chest following the
     administration of 100 cc of intravenous Optiray.  Additional thin section
     reformatted images are provided.
     
     CONTRAST:  Intravenous nonionic contrast was administered due to the rapid
     rate of bolus injection required for this examination.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The aorta is normal in caliber,
     with scattered mural calcifications consistent with atheromatous disease.
     There are mild coronary artery calcifications.  Multiple small mediastinal,
     hilar, and axillary lymph nodes are seen, not individually meeting criteria
     for pathologic enlargement.  The largest of these, located in the right hilum,
     measures 8 mm in short axis diameter.  The airways are patent to the level of
     the segmental bronchi bilaterally.  There are multifocal areas of patchy
     opacity throughout the lungs, most prominently located within the right middle
     lobe and within the anterior segment of the left upper lobe.  In addition,
     there are tiny bilateral pleural effusions and minimal adjacent atelectasis
     within the lower lobes.  There is a suggestion of peripheral septal thickening
     at the apices.  Two tiny, calcified nodular opacities are seen at the left
     apex, consistent with prior granulomatous disease.
     
     Limited images of the upper abdomen, including limited images of the liver,
     spleen, adrenal glands, and upper poles of the kidneys, demonstrate fullness
     of the right adrenal gland without definite focal mass identified, a finding
     that is consistent with the PET CT finding of abnormal uptake within the
     adrenal glands.  No mass or fullness is identified within the left adrenal
     gland.  There is a simple cyst arising from the upper pole of the left kidney
     containing internal fluid density.  The visualized portions of the liver and
     spleen appear unremarkable.  Heterogeneity within the spleen is likely related
     to the phase of contrast administration.
     
     The appearance of the osseous structures is unchanged, with increased

     INDICATION:  Enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma and neutropenia,
     tachycardic and tachypneic with respiratory alkalosis, please evaluate new
     right lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray and rule out empyema.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT of the chest dated [**3353-1-15**], and PET CT dated
     [**3353-1-17**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained through the chest following the
     administration of 100 cc of intravenous Optiray.  Additional thin section
     reformatted images are provided.
     
     CONTRAST:  Intravenous nonionic contrast was administered due to the rapid
     rate of bolus injection required for this examination.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The aorta is normal in caliber,
     with scattered mural calcifications consistent with atheromatous disease.
     There are mild coronary artery calcifications.  Multiple small mediastinal,
     hilar, and axillary lymph nodes are seen, not individually meeting criteria
     for pathologic enlargement.  The largest of these, located in the right hilum,
     measures 8 mm in short axis diameter.  The airways are patent to the level of
     the segmental bronchi bilaterally.  There are multifocal areas of patchy
     opacity throughout the lungs, most prominently located within the right middle
     lobe and within the anterior segment of the left upper lobe.  In addition,
     there are tiny bilateral pleural effusions and minimal adjacent atelectasis
     within the lower lobes.  There is a suggestion of peripheral septal thickening
     at the apices.  Two tiny, calcified nodular opacities are seen at the left
     apex, consistent with prior granulomatous disease.
     
     Limited images of the upper abdomen, including limited images of the liver,
     spleen, adrenal glands, and upper poles of the kidneys, demonstrate fullness
     of the right adrenal gland without definite focal mass identified, a finding
     that is consistent with the PET CT finding of abnormal uptake within the
     adrenal glands.  No mass or fullness is identified within the left adrenal
     gland.  There is a simple cyst arising from the upper pole of the left kidney
     containing internal fluid density.  The visualized portions of the liver and
     spleen appear unremarkable.  Heterogeneity within the spleen is likely related
     to the phase of contrast administration.
     
     The appearance of the osseous structures is unchanged, with increased
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  89-year-old woman with altered mental status and fevers with
     leukocytosis on multiple antibiotics.  History of right upper quadrant
     abdominal pain.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis [**3380-11-5**].
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Subsegmental atelectasis is seen in both
     lung bases with adjacent small bilateral pleural effusions.  The visualized
     aorta is heavily calcified and ectatic.  The visualized heart demonstrates
     coronary artery calcifications.  There is cardiomegaly.
     
     Evaluation of the abdominal organs is somewhat limited secondary to artifact
     from the patient's arm.  However, again seen in the posterior aspect of the
     right lobe of the liver is a 1-cm rounded low-density focus which most likely
     represents a simple liver cyst.  No other focal liver lesions or biliary
     ductal dilatation is identified.  The gallbladder is distended, but there is
     no gallbladder wall edema or gallstones to suggest cholecystitis.  Again seen
     within the body of the pancreas (series 2, image 27) is a 11-mm low-density
     cystic structure which is stable since the recent prior examination.  The
     remainder of the pancreas is unremarkable and there is no pancreatic ductal
     dilatation.  The spleen is normal in appearance.  Again seen throughout the
     bilateral kidneys are multiple rounded low-density foci, many of which are too
     small to characterize.  Two large hypodense lesions are seen in the left
     kidney measuring up to 4.5 cm.  The majority of these are too small to
     characterize but the large foci are consistent with simple renal cysts.  There
     is no evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter.  The cortex of the kidney
     enhances normally and symmetrically.  The stomach and intra-abdominal loops of
     small and large bowel are normal in appearance and caliber.  There is no
     evidence of free air or free fluid.  There is no pathologically enlarged
     mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The sigmoid colon demonstrates diverticulosis
     without diverticulitis.  The rectum and intrapelvic loops of small bowel are
     unremarkable. The bladder is collapsed around Foley catheter but is otherwise
     unremarkable. The patient is status post hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-
     oophorectomy. There is no pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic
     lymphadenopathy.  There is no free fluid.  There is a 5.2 x 2.4 cm rounded
     fat-containing inguinal hernia.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     The visualized aorta is normal in caliber throughout the abdomen but
     atherosclerotic calcifications are seen at the origin of the renal arteries,

     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions,
     however, again seen is vertebral body height loss at T10 which is stable in
     appearance.
     
     CT REFORMATS:  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the axial
     findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No definite evidence of intra-abdominal infectious process.  Distended
     gallbladder without evidence for gallstones or gallbladder wall edema to
     suggest cholecystitis.  If clinically indicated a gallbladder ultrasound could
     be performed for definitive evaluation
     2.  Cystic lesion within the pancreas.  This could be definitively evaluated
     with CTA of the pancreas when the patient's clinical condition improves. There
     has been no change in the short interval since the last study.
     3.  Multiple low-density foci within the kidneys, the larger ones representing
     simple renal cysts.  The smaller ones are too small to characterize.
     4. Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications of the abdominal aorta and its
     branches.
     5. Small hypodensity within the liver dome which is too small to characterize.
     6.  Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine including vertebral body height
     loss at T10, which may represent an old compression fracture, unchanged.

     stable blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  The left CPA has been
     excluded from the study.  There is interval resolution of patchy air space
     opacity seen in the right lower lung zones.  However, there remains subtle
     diffuse linear interstitial opacities throughout both lungs, improved from the
     prior study.  No focal consolidation is present.  There is no pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Resolution of previously seen left lower lung zone air space opacities.
     
     2) Mild persistent interstitial opacities, which could represent resolving
     atypical pneumonia or resolving interstitial edema.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is retired and had been living
at home with his wife prior to his admission to the hospital
on [**2682-8-29**]; he had been living at [**Hospital3 6366**] for the day prior to admission.  He is a
social drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;
although, he quit smoking 20 years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical
examination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,
heart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following
administration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory
was 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal
cannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There
were normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were
hypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft
pulse, dopplerable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis
pulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,
and intact.  Please note that the above examination was done
by the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was
initially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial
laboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell
count of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets
were 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR
was 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,
potassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood
urea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose
was 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and
phosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were
pending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on
admission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out
yeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also
initially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated
stable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no
focal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of
the chest compared with a [**2682-9-2**] study.  No
radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or
pneumonia.

His admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,
nonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages
in the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when
compared with an electrocardiogram dated [**2682-8-30**].

An initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination
that demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No
evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,
incompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple
left renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and
partially calcified prostate gland.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to
the Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased
urine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary
to a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were
never any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).

While boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the
night of admission, the patient had a sudden
cardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with
epinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion
times four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.

Following these measures, the patient returned to a sinus
rhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;
the total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to
the return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He
subsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood
pressure.

An echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a
trivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a
hyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided
filling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this
arrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a
non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were
elevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.

A repeat echocardiogram done on [**2682-9-8**]
demonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction
of 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities
including inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular
akinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and
moderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study
of [**2682-9-7**]; the left ventricular function was
unchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the
right ventricular function appeared worse.

On [**2682-9-8**], the patient was loaded with amiodarone
and was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The
following day, he was started on heparin intravenously given
his elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this
medication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated
troponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient
was a candidate for cardiac catheterization.

After discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit
team and the patient's family, however, the decision was made
to not pursue further invasive procedures given that the
patient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate
following the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family
no longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.

By [**2682-9-10**], he was off pressors and he was
restarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.

On the evening of [**2682-9-12**], the patient complained
of substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and
morphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3
that reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.
Therefore, the patient was again started on heparin;
although, this was discontinued on [**2682-9-13**] when
the patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac
enzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on [**2682-9-14**]; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he
again ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac
enzymes.

By hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence
of congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid
resuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.
By the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service
on [**2682-9-13**], the patient was still significantly
volume overloaded following his aggressive fluid
resuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,
he was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that
he was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive
heart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of
his discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was
greater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on
gentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the
levofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already
taking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to
admission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative
urosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous
fluids.

On [**2682-9-8**], his levofloxacin and metronidazole was
discontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the
growth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of
gentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was
discontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious
Disease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on
[**2682-9-15**], and his piperacillin/tazobactam was
discontinued on [**2682-9-16**].

Despite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis
precipitating this admission, the patient did not have any
positive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of
yeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained
afebrile both before and after discontinuation of his
antibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile
negative on [**2682-9-15**].

3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and
he was extubated on [**2682-9-11**].  He subsequently
developed wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to
cardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his
aggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed
toward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his
he was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%
on 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium
nebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his
respiratory secretions.

4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure
and prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid
resuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum
creatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.

5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly
malnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once
he was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a
modified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin
liquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,
small bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and
aspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with
and between meals for nutritional supplementation of his
heart-healthy/diabetic diet.

6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot
ulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was
started on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved
wound healing.

7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of
packed red blood cells on [**2682-9-14**] to maintain a
hematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe
coronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently
remained stable.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

     STUDY:  CT torso.
     
     INDICATION:  59-year-old female with a history of metastatic renal cell
     cancer, presenting with worsening dyspnea and cough.
     
     COMPARISONS:  [**2745-5-21**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast MDCT axial images of the abdomen were acquired.
     Following the administration of 100 cc of Optiray 350 intravenous contrast,
     MDCT axial images were acquired from the thoracic inlet to the pubic
     symphysis.  Three-minute axial delayed images were acquired through the
     kidneys.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were then obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There has been a slight interval
     progression in the multiple pulmonary metastatic lesions.  A right upper
     paratracheal lymph node now measures 6.4 x 5.8 cm which is not significantly
     changed from the previous measurements of 7.2 x 6.1 cm (series 3, image 19).
     There has been interval increase in right upper lobe collapse.  Aside from
     multiple pulmonary metastases, the lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart and
     great vessels are unremarkable.  There is no pericardial effusion.  There are
     no pleural effusions.
     
     On today's examination of the anterior branch of the left upper lobe segmental
     bronchus appears to be compressed by the left hilar mass which is new compared
     to the examination of [**2745-5-21**]. The apical and posterior branches are patent.
     Both the lingular, left lower lobe, and right main stem bronchi are noted to
     be extrinsically narrowed by the hilar lymphadenopathy.  The airways are
     otherwise patent to the segmental level.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  A hypodense lesion within the right lobe
     of the liver on today's examination measures 16 x 14 mm which is smaller
     compared to the previous measurements of 19 x 18 mm (series 3, image 55).  No
     new lesions are identified throughout the liver.  There is no intra- or extra-
     hepatic biliary dilatation.  The gallbladder is noted to be mildly distended.
     A hypodense lesion within the right kidney, interpolar region, measuring 1.2
     cm in diameter is unchanged compared to the previous examination (series 3,
     image 78).  The patient is status post left nephrectomy and left
     adrenalectomy.  There is no evidence of recurrence of tumor within the
     resection bed.  There is a new focus of hypodensity within the lateral aspect
                                                                 (Over)

     of the spleen, which is too small to characterize (series 3, image 61).  The
     spleen is otherwise unremarkable.  The pancreas, right adrenal gland, stomach
     and abdominal portions of the large and small bowel appear within normal
     limits.  There is no abdominal fluid or free air.  No mesenteric or
     retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is present.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  A complex left cystic adnexal mass on
     today's examination measures 2.9 x 2.4 cm which is approximately unchanged
     compared to the previous examination (series 3, image 103).  A calcified
     fibroid uterus is again noted.  The bladder is unremarkable.  The rectum and
     sigmoid colon appear within normal limits.  There is no free fluid within the
     pelvis.  No pathologic pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes are noted.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Interval increase in size and extension of thoracic metastatic lesions.
     New apparent extrinsic compression of the anterior branch of the left upper
     lobe segmental bronchus. Increase in collapse of the right upper lobe
     secondary to local mass effect.
     
     2.  Interval decrease in size of hepatic metastasis.
     
     3.  Stable, complex left adnexal cystic mass.
     
     4.  Stable appearance of right renal simple cyst.

     HISTORY: Severe abdominal pain, hypotension.  Please assess the aorta with a
     non-contrast scan.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained through
     the abdomen and pelvis, without the administration of IV or oral contrast, as
     per the request of the emergency room attending physician caring for the
     patient.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are incompletely imaged coronary
     artery calcifications.  There is dependent atelectasis within the visualized
     portions of the lung bases.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and
     right kidney are unremarkable. The gallbladder is distended.  There is an
     approximately 5 cm exophytic simple cyst in the upper pole of the left kidney.
     The left kidney is otherwise unremarkable.  There are diffuse vascular
     calcifications throughout the abdomen. There is diffuse calcification of the
     intra-abdominal aorta and common iliac arteries.  There is no evidence,
     however, of aneurysmal dilatation of the aorta or gross dissection (this is a
     limited assessment for dissection, given the non-contrast nature of this
     examination).  There is no free air, free fluid, or lymphadenopathy within the
     abdomen.  The unopacified loops of large/small bowel are unremarkable. There
     is no evidence of bowel obstruction.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Again noted are diffuse vascular
     calcifications.  A Foley catheter is seen within a collapsed urinary bladder.
     There are multiple sigmoid diverticula without evidence of associated
     inflammatory changes.  The rectum and visualized loops of bowel are
     unremarkable.  There is an enlarged and partially calcified prostate gland.
     There is no free air or free fluid within the pelvis.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate diffuse degenerative changes of the visualized spine.
     There is a solitary bone island of the right ischium.  The osseous structures
     are otherwise unremarkable.

MICU NPN 7PM-7AM:
Neuro: Pt alert, follows commands at the beginning of the shift. Opens eyes to commands. He denied pain at 8PM but did c/o discomfort and requested something to relax him. He was given 2mg IV ativan and did well. No further sedation required overnight. Pt MAE. Nods ead to questions. Has good cough and gag. His family say his baseline is pleasant but forgetful. He does reach to pull out the ETT when left untied so he is restained for safety.

Cardiac: BP stable 120-130/60. Pt is on Amiodarone via NGT TID. Tolerating this well. HR 80-95 most of the shift. Has rare to occ. PVC/APC. Swan numbers done Q6hrs as ordered and probably swan will come out today. CVP 7-9, PCW 16-20, CO [**6-2**] and SVR 800-900. He remains on heparin drip which needed to be decreased to 750u/hr at 11PM for PTT 110. Repeat PTT will be sent at 5AM.

Resp: Stable gas on AC 14, TV 500, FIO2 30% with 5cm peep. Plan to put pt on PSV early today and try to extubate him. The team needs to meet with the family and decide on if he wil be reintubated if he fails. He has been suctioned for thick pale yellow to white secretions. Lungs are coarse.

GI: Pt is NPO except for meds. +BS noted. No stool.

GU: UO excellent via foley. Urine is cloudy/sedimented.

ID: Pt is afebrile. Lactic acid is 1.0. He continues on vanco/fluconozole/zosyn.

Skin: Pt has bad necrotic coccyx area noted with open bleeding areas. I applied collaginase to the area but it needs to be seen by team today. I took off a duoderm that was falling off the wound. His incisions on his left leg are red and swolloen somewhat. No drainage noted. I dressed his feet wounds as orderd. No change in these wounds noted. They too have necrosis noted.

Social: Family has been in aggreement that pt does not have good quality of life now at his baseline and they have been discussing with team about withdrawal of care. Further decisions regarding this matter need to be addressed today prior to extubation. He remains full treat but DNR until then.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       63 year old man with h/o ESRD on HD with new SVC syndrome, poorly functioning 
      L  AVF.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      functioning AVF, clots in upper torso?                                          
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     HISTORY: 63 year old male with end stage renal disease on dialysis through
     left arm brachiocephalic arteriovenous (AV) fistula, now presents with
     significant swelling of left face and both arms with left side being worse.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 603**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 470**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 291**] [**Doctor Last Name 292**] d'Othee, with the attending
     radiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 292**] [**Name (STitle) 293**] being present for the entire procedure. Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 212**] reviewed the exam.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The risks and benefits were explained to the patient
     and consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the angiographic
     table and the right arm was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Local
     anesthesia using 1% Lidocaine was applied to the puncture site. Under
     sonographic guidance, the left cephalic vein near the arteriovenous fistula
     was accessed using a 21 gauge needle and an 0.018 wire was placed into the
     vein toward the venous side. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture
     sheath which was connected to the power injector.
     AV fistulogram was performed along the course of the cephalic vein to the
     level of the right atrium. The venograms demonstrated a focal stenosis in the
     dilated cephalic vein at the level of the mid arm and also confirmed the
     known, severe stenosis of the superior vena cava (SVC). There is a left
     internal jugular dialysis catheter with its tip in the SVC. This might be
     related to the development of the stenosis. No intrathoracic collateral is
     seen; there is, however, collateral filling from the left mid-arm towards the
     axilla and then left lateral thoracic wall caudally.
     Pressure measurements were performed through a 5-French straight catheter.
     They demonstrated mean pressures of 13 mmHg in the right atrium and 31 mmHg in
     the left brachiocephalic vein (i.e., gradient of 18 mmHg).
     A pressure cuff was insufflated over the upper arm and a venogram was
     repeated. It revealed patency of the arteriovenous anastomosis and the
     brachial artery proximally and distally to the anastomosis with no significant
     stenosis.
                                                                 (Over)

     Thereafter, an 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 471**] wire was placed through the sheath and advanced
     under fluoroscopy until its tip was in the inferior vena cava. The
     micropuncture sheath was exchanged for a 6 French sheath. The focal stenosis
     in the cephalic vein was dilated using a 6 mm X 4 cm balloon. Resolution of
     the narrowing was shown on a follow-up venogram.
     The sheath was removed and a 18 mm X 4 cm balloon was placed over the wire
     into the stenotic SVC and dilated repeatedly under fluoroscopy up to 5
     atmospheres. Follow up venograms through the sidearm of the sheath showed
     significant improvement of the diameter of the SVC. Repeat pressure
     measurements through a 4 French multiside hole straight catheter showed
     complete resolution of pressure gradient across the superior vena cava.
     The catheter and sheath were then removed and local hemostasis was achieved by
     manual compression. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no
     complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS: For conscious sedation, a total of 75 micrograms of Fentanyl was
     given in small divided intravenous doses under continuous hemodynamic
     monitoring. Total of 165 ml IV Optiray 320 dilated by half.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Major, symptomatic stenosis of the superior vena cava. Low-pressure
     balloon venoplasty (18 mm) resulted in highly satisfactory immediate
     angiographic and manometric results.
     
     2.  Focal stenosis in the left cephalic vein at the mid-arm level. This was
     dilated to 6 mm in diameter with no immediate complication.

MICU NPN 3PM-11PM:
Neuro: Pt is restless at times with some movements in all extremities but does not follow my commands to squeeze my hand or open his eyes. Pupils are 4MM equal and reactive to light bilaterally. His sedation had been off since the day shift and he was getting more and more restless and coughing and chewing on the ETT constantly. After discussion with team the decision was made to use PRN ativan boluses which have been effective to keep him more comfortable.

Resp: Remains on AC 18, TV 600, FIO2 40% with 8cm peep. Good sats. Stable gas. Suctioned frequently in the beginning of the shift. He has mod amts thick pale yellow secretions via the ETT as well as orally. Lungs are coarse.

Cardiac: Weaned off the levophed by mid-shift. BP 90-130/60. GOAL MAP >60. Also lido drip shut off and pt bolused with amiodarone 150mg then started on infusion of amio at 1mg/min which should be changed to .5mg/min at 11:15PM. He needs the amiodarone at .5mg/min continuously for 18hrs then they will assess if he can be switched to PO regimen. He has had much less ectopy and no runs of VT since starting the amio drip. He tolerated the bolus well without hypotension. His triponin came back greater than 50 today so he is being treated for acute MI. He was given aspirin one tab via the NGT and started on heparin drip. No bolus was given. Infusion started at 6:30PM so he needs PTT at 12:30PM. The heparin sliding scale is in the orders and drip needs to be adjusted according the scale. His swan numbers show SVR 900. CO 5.4. PCW 18-22. He has been getting 500cc's fluid boluses intermittently as ordered by MD and numbers need to be checked one-half hour later. 

GI: OGT inserted for meds. CXR confirmed good placement. +BS

GU: UO 30-40cc/hr. Urine dark cloudy. Grew out yeast in urine and given fluconazole 400mg via OGT.

ID: Afebrile. WBC down to 18 this evening. Continues on gent/vanco/zosyn. I sent blood culture with fungal isolator tonight as ordered.

Skin: Dressing on his right toes and left heal and side of foot changed. Areas look necrotic. 

Social: Large family who are very involved. Pt apparently has had poor quality of life recently with mild alzheimer's dementia, poor circulation, neuropathy, diabetes and spent the major part of his life in bed these days. They are comfortable with their decision for DNR and even question whether we should continue to be as aggressive as we are. I can tell they struggle with their decision but reassured them that right now there is no decisions to be made and just give him time to see which direction he goes.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       63 year old man with h/o ESRD on HD with new SVC syndrome, poorly functioning 
      L  AVF.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      functioning AVF, clots in upper torso?                                          
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     HISTORY: 63 year old male with end stage renal disease on dialysis through
     left arm brachiocephalic arteriovenous (AV) fistula, now presents with
     significant swelling of left face and both arms with left side being worse.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 603**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 470**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 291**] [**Doctor Last Name 292**] d'Othee, with the attending
     radiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 292**] [**Name (STitle) 293**] being present for the entire procedure. Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 212**] reviewed the exam.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The risks and benefits were explained to the patient
     and consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the angiographic
     table and the right arm was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Local
     anesthesia using 1% Lidocaine was applied to the puncture site. Under
     sonographic guidance, the left cephalic vein near the arteriovenous fistula
     was accessed using a 21 gauge needle and an 0.018 wire was placed into the
     vein toward the venous side. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture
     sheath which was connected to the power injector.
     AV fistulogram was performed along the course of the cephalic vein to the
     level of the right atrium. The venograms demonstrated a focal stenosis in the
     dilated cephalic vein at the level of the mid arm and also confirmed the
     known, severe stenosis of the superior vena cava (SVC). There is a left
     internal jugular dialysis catheter with its tip in the SVC. This might be
     related to the development of the stenosis. No intrathoracic collateral is
     seen; there is, however, collateral filling from the left mid-arm towards the
     axilla and then left lateral thoracic wall caudally.
     Pressure measurements were performed through a 5-French straight catheter.
     They demonstrated mean pressures of 13 mmHg in the right atrium and 31 mmHg in
     the left brachiocephalic vein (i.e., gradient of 18 mmHg).
     A pressure cuff was insufflated over the upper arm and a venogram was
     repeated. It revealed patency of the arteriovenous anastomosis and the
     brachial artery proximally and distally to the anastomosis with no significant
     stenosis.
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     
     Thereafter, an 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 471**] wire was placed through the sheath and advanced
     under fluoroscopy until its tip was in the inferior vena cava. The
     micropuncture sheath was exchanged for a 6 French sheath. The focal stenosis
     in the cephalic vein was dilated using a 6 mm X 4 cm balloon. Resolution of
     the narrowing was shown on a follow-up venogram.
     The sheath was removed and a 18 mm X 4 cm balloon was placed over the wire
     into the stenotic SVC and dilated repeatedly under fluoroscopy up to 5
     atmospheres. Follow up venograms through the sidearm of the sheath showed
     significant improvement of the diameter of the SVC. Repeat pressure
     measurements through a 4 French multiside hole straight catheter showed
     complete resolution of pressure gradient across the superior vena cava.
     The catheter and sheath were then removed and local hemostasis was achieved by
     manual compression. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no
     complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS: For conscious sedation, a total of 75 micrograms of Fentanyl was
     given in small divided intravenous doses under continuous hemodynamic
     monitoring. Total of 165 ml IV Optiray 320 dilated by half.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Major, symptomatic stenosis of the superior vena cava. Low-pressure
     balloon venoplasty (18 mm) resulted in highly satisfactory immediate
     angiographic and manometric results.
     
     2.  Focal stenosis in the left cephalic vein at the mid-arm level. This was
     dilated to 6 mm in diameter with no immediate complication.

     table and the right arm was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Local
     anesthesia using 1% Lidocaine was applied to the puncture site. Under
     sonographic guidance, the left cephalic vein near the arteriovenous fistula
     was accessed using a 21 gauge needle and an 0.018 wire was placed into the
     vein toward the venous side. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture
     sheath which was connected to the power injector.
     AV fistulogram was performed along the course of the cephalic vein to the
     level of the right atrium. The venograms demonstrated a focal stenosis in the
     dilated cephalic vein at the level of the mid arm and also confirmed the
     known, severe stenosis of the superior vena cava (SVC). There is a left
     internal jugular dialysis catheter with its tip in the SVC. This might be
     related to the development of the stenosis. No intrathoracic collateral is
     seen; there is, however, collateral filling from the left mid-arm towards the
     axilla and then left lateral thoracic wall caudally.
     Pressure measurements were performed through a 5-French straight catheter.
     They demonstrated mean pressures of 13 mmHg in the right atrium and 31 mmHg in
     the left brachiocephalic vein (i.e., gradient of 18 mmHg).
     A pressure cuff was insufflated over the upper arm and a venogram was
     repeated. It revealed patency of the arteriovenous anastomosis and the
     brachial artery proximally and distally to the anastomosis with no significant
     stenosis.
                                                                 (Over)

     Thereafter, an 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 471**] wire was placed through the sheath and advanced
     under fluoroscopy until its tip was in the inferior vena cava. The
     micropuncture sheath was exchanged for a 6 French sheath. The focal stenosis
     in the cephalic vein was dilated using a 6 mm X 4 cm balloon. Resolution of
     the narrowing was shown on a follow-up venogram.
     The sheath was removed and a 18 mm X 4 cm balloon was placed over the wire
     into the stenotic SVC and dilated repeatedly under fluoroscopy up to 5
     atmospheres. Follow up venograms through the sidearm of the sheath showed
     significant improvement of the diameter of the SVC. Repeat pressure
     measurements through a 4 French multiside hole straight catheter showed
     complete resolution of pressure gradient across the superior vena cava.
     The catheter and sheath were then removed and local hemostasis was achieved by
     manual compression. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no
     complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS: For conscious sedation, a total of 75 micrograms of Fentanyl was
     given in small divided intravenous doses under continuous hemodynamic
     monitoring. Total of 165 ml IV Optiray 320 dilated by half.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Major, symptomatic stenosis of the superior vena cava. Low-pressure
     balloon venoplasty (18 mm) resulted in highly satisfactory immediate
     angiographic and manometric results.
     
     2.  Focal stenosis in the left cephalic vein at the mid-arm level. This was
     dilated to 6 mm in diameter with no immediate complication.

     speech pathologist. The patient was given oral barium of varying
     consistencies. There was no delay in swallowing, but mild premature spillover
     with all consistencies. There was trace penetration with the thin liquid (only
     after multiple continuous swallows), but no gross aspiration.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Trace penetration with thin liquids, but no evidence of
     aspiration.  Please see the complete report of the speech pathologist for
     additional findings and recommendations.

     or effusion.  Check current status.
     
     FINDINGS:  A single AP semiupright chest image is provided.  Comparison study
     dated 1 day earlier.  The heart again shows moderate left ventricular
     enlargement.  Slight upper zone redistribution is noted, associated with
     blurring of vascular detail at the bases.  There is also again evidence of
     bilateral pleural effusions.  There is left lower lobe collapse/consolidation.
     These findings are essentially unchanged since the prior study.  The right IJ
     central line remains in good position.
     
     IMPRESSION:  These findings are consistent with moderate left heart failure
     with early pulmonary edema, not significantly changed since the prior study.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       63 year old man with h/o ESRD on HD with new SVC syndrome, poorly functioning 
      L  AVF.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      functioning AVF, clots in upper torso?                                          
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     HISTORY: 63 year old male with end stage renal disease on dialysis through
     left arm brachiocephalic arteriovenous (AV) fistula, now presents with
     significant swelling of left face and both arms with left side being worse.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 603**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 470**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 291**] [**Doctor Last Name 292**] d'Othee, with the attending
     radiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 292**] [**Name (STitle) 293**] being present for the entire procedure. Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 212**] reviewed the exam.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The risks and benefits were explained to the patient
     and consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the angiographic
     table and the right arm was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Local
     anesthesia using 1% Lidocaine was applied to the puncture site. Under
     sonographic guidance, the left cephalic vein near the arteriovenous fistula
     was accessed using a 21 gauge needle and an 0.018 wire was placed into the
     vein toward the venous side. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture
     sheath which was connected to the power injector.
     AV fistulogram was performed along the course of the cephalic vein to the
     level of the right atrium. The venograms demonstrated a focal stenosis in the
     dilated cephalic vein at the level of the mid arm and also confirmed the
     known, severe stenosis of the superior vena cava (SVC). There is a left
     internal jugular dialysis catheter with its tip in the SVC. This might be
     related to the development of the stenosis. No intrathoracic collateral is
     seen; there is, however, collateral filling from the left mid-arm towards the
     axilla and then left lateral thoracic wall caudally.
     Pressure measurements were performed through a 5-French straight catheter.
     They demonstrated mean pressures of 13 mmHg in the right atrium and 31 mmHg in
     the left brachiocephalic vein (i.e., gradient of 18 mmHg).
     A pressure cuff was insufflated over the upper arm and a venogram was
     repeated. It revealed patency of the arteriovenous anastomosis and the
     brachial artery proximally and distally to the anastomosis with no significant
     stenosis.
                                                                 (Over)

     Thereafter, an 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 471**] wire was placed through the sheath and advanced
     under fluoroscopy until its tip was in the inferior vena cava. The
     micropuncture sheath was exchanged for a 6 French sheath. The focal stenosis
     in the cephalic vein was dilated using a 6 mm X 4 cm balloon. Resolution of
     the narrowing was shown on a follow-up venogram.
     The sheath was removed and a 18 mm X 4 cm balloon was placed over the wire
     into the stenotic SVC and dilated repeatedly under fluoroscopy up to 5
     atmospheres. Follow up venograms through the sidearm of the sheath showed
     significant improvement of the diameter of the SVC. Repeat pressure
     measurements through a 4 French multiside hole straight catheter showed
     complete resolution of pressure gradient across the superior vena cava.
     The catheter and sheath were then removed and local hemostasis was achieved by
     manual compression. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no
     complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS: For conscious sedation, a total of 75 micrograms of Fentanyl was
     given in small divided intravenous doses under continuous hemodynamic
     monitoring. Total of 165 ml IV Optiray 320 dilated by half.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Major, symptomatic stenosis of the superior vena cava. Low-pressure
     balloon venoplasty (18 mm) resulted in highly satisfactory immediate
     angiographic and manometric results.
     
     2.  Focal stenosis in the left cephalic vein at the mid-arm level. This was
     dilated to 6 mm in diameter with no immediate complication.

     REASON:  Patient s/p left lower extremity bypass graft, perform follow up
     surveillance.
     
     FINDINGS:  Duplex evaluation was performed in the left lower extremity from
     femoral vein to tibial artery bypass graft.  The peak systolic velocities in
     cm/sec. are as follows:  101, 108, 119, 91 in the native proximal vessel,
     proximal anasatomosis, distal anastomosis and native distal vessel
     respectively.  Throughout the body of the graft velocities range from 34
     through 101.  At the area just proximal to the distal anastomosis there is one
     peak velocity ratio greater than 2.  However, the peak systolic velocity at
     this location is only 101 cm/sec.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Widely patent left superficial femoral artery to anterior tibial
     artery bypass graft.  Throughout the body of the graft most of the velocities
     are in the high 30's to 40 range which can be seen in distal tibial bypass
     grafts.  As noted there is one area where a peak velocity ratio is greater
     than 2.  This is consistent with approximately a 50% stenosis at this area.
     However as noted above the gross peak systolic velocity at this location is
     only 101 cm/sec.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8351**] is a 72-year-old
gentleman with a history of Hodgkin's disease was transferred
here from [**Hospital3 773**] Hospital because of intractable seizures
and decreased mental status.

He was in his usual state of health, active and playing golf,
until [**8-16**] when he began to become "confused" and developed
gait difficulties.  According to the family, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8351**] was
behaving in a way that was perceived to be nontypical by family
members. He was also having gait difficulties that were
considered to be mild, according to the family members.

Because of these symptoms, he was evaluated at [**Hospital3 773**] Hospital
on [**8-16**]. At that time, a head computed tomography was
reported as normal. He was give a diagnosis of transient ischemic
attacks and was d/c home.

Over the next three days, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8352**] problems gradually
worsened.  On [**8-19**], he was at home when he developed a
nonfocal onset of seizure which was later generalized.    He
was transferred to the nearest Emergency Department where he
continued to have generalized seizures.  He was given a
Dilantin load and phenobarbital.  His systolic blood pressure
at that time ranged between 120 and 200s.

A repeat head CT was reported to be normal. Despite the Dilantin
load and the phenobarbiltal, the patient continued to have
clinical seizured. Therefore, he was started on an Ativan drip
and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. His Dilantin was
also continued on therapeutic levels.  Despite the Ativan drip
and Dilantin therapeutic levels, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8351**] continued to be
unresponsive and had intermittent seizures. The rate of the
Ativan IV infusion was increased and the patient was intubated. A
lumbar puncture was performed on [**8-19**] at [**Hospital3 773**] Hospital
and showed normal values.

A MRI with diffusion- weighted imaging showed diffuse
hyperintensity in the cerebral cortex (R > L) and both thalami.

At this point, the patient remained intubated and unresponsive
and was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 33**] for further evaluation and
care.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hodgkin's disease diagnosed in [**2676-4-9**] after
developing a respiratory infection.  This was diagnosed as
nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease; stage III-B with
positive [**Doctor Last Name **]-Sternberg cells.  A bone marrow biopsy was done
in [**2676-8-9**] which showed no bone marrow involvement.
2.  Status post chemotherapy with bleomycin, Cytoxan,
vincristine, and procarbazine two years ago.  This had to be
discontinued after three cycles because of interstitial lung
disease and because of myelosuppression with episodes of
neutropenic fever.  Most recent surveillance computed
tomography scan revealed gradual interval progression of
Hodgkin's disease with slightly large mediastinal lymph[**MD Number **].
3.  Borderline hypertension.
4.  Colonic polyps.
5.  Tuberculosis.
6.  Cataracts.
7.  Macular degeneration.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin, Prevacid, and Tylenol.
Ativan drip and Dilantin were started at the outside
hospital.

ALLERGIES:  CEFTIN (causes a rash).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a retired chemistry teacher
and lived in [**Hospital3 773**].  He was married with no alcohol or
intravenous drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was noncontributory.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8351**] was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of [**Hospital1 33**] on
[**2677-8-21**]. A repeat LP on admission showed normal cells, glucose
and protein. A CSF sample was also obtained for viral cultures
and different viral and fungal Ab titers (including West Nile
Virus, Arboviruses, HSV, HBVs). Routine cultures for bacterial,
TB and other infectious agents were also normal. Cytology was
normal.

Despite the therapeutic levels of PTN and the IV infusion of
Ativan, electroencephalogram (EEG) on admission showed
epileptiform sharp spike activity suggestive of ongoing
epileptict activity. Therefore, a Penotarbital infusion was
started. The Pentobarbital infusion was titrated to obtain a
burst- suppression pattern on bedside 24 h, EEG monitoring. In
particular, the EEG showed sharp waves complexes every 6 to 10
seconds. Dilantin and Depakote were continued as well. At this
point, pressors were started to compensate to the Pentobarbital-
induced decreased cardiac function.

Mr [**Known patient lastname 8351**] condition did not improve and another magnetic resonance
imaging examination ([**8-23**]) showed multicentric areas of T2
hyperintensity with more concentration in the right frontal as
well as bilateral thalami. Laboratory studies throughout Mr.
[**Known patient lastname 8352**] admission included several blood cultures, urine cultures
and extensive toxic metabolic workup. Another LP for
cerebrospinal fluid analysis for infection, toxic metabolic and
cytological analysis was also performed.

In order to better elucidate the underlying pathology. A brain
and meningeal biopsy was performed on [**8-23**] in the right
frontal lobe.

In regards to empiric treatment, after the brain biopsy, the
patient received IV Solu- Medrol and high doses of antibiotics
with broad coverage.  The Infectious Disease team was also
involved in the care of Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8351**]. All the tests performed on his
tissues and fuids obtained under request of the ID team, had
thus far come back normal.

Brain and meningeal biopsy were remarkable for an meningitic
eosinophilic infiltrates and extensive ischemic cortical neuronal
damage (red neurons). There was no evidence of an infectious
[**Doctor Last Name 82**] on traditional staining and/or on electronic microscopy.

Several attempts in decreasing the dose of Pentobarbital resulted
in an increased epileptiform activity on bedside EEG monitor.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8352**] condition deteriorated even further. He had developed
ileus, and his abdomen was hyperextended.  He had been intubated
throughout his entire stay in the Intensive Care Unit and was
increasingly dependent on ventilatory support.

At this point, the patient's  poor clincal status and prognosis
was thoroughly discussed with his closest family members. After
a family meeting, it was decided that Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8351**] would no longer
benefit from aggressive support.  Therefore, he was extubated
and expired briefly thereafter.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       63 year old man with h/o ESRD on HD with new SVC syndrome, poorly functioning 
      L  AVF.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      functioning AVF, clots in upper torso?                                          
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     HISTORY: 63 year old male with end stage renal disease on dialysis through
     left arm brachiocephalic arteriovenous (AV) fistula, now presents with
     significant swelling of left face and both arms with left side being worse.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 603**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 470**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 291**] [**Doctor Last Name 292**] d'Othee, with the attending
     radiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 292**] [**Name (STitle) 293**] being present for the entire procedure. Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 212**] reviewed the exam.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The risks and benefits were explained to the patient
     and consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the angiographic
     table and the right arm was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Local
     anesthesia using 1% Lidocaine was applied to the puncture site. Under
     sonographic guidance, the left cephalic vein near the arteriovenous fistula
     was accessed using a 21 gauge needle and an 0.018 wire was placed into the
     vein toward the venous side. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture
     sheath which was connected to the power injector.
     AV fistulogram was performed along the course of the cephalic vein to the
     level of the right atrium. The venograms demonstrated a focal stenosis in the
     dilated cephalic vein at the level of the mid arm and also confirmed the
     known, severe stenosis of the superior vena cava (SVC). There is a left
     internal jugular dialysis catheter with its tip in the SVC. This might be
     related to the development of the stenosis. No intrathoracic collateral is
     seen; there is, however, collateral filling from the left mid-arm towards the
     axilla and then left lateral thoracic wall caudally.
     Pressure measurements were performed through a 5-French straight catheter.
     They demonstrated mean pressures of 13 mmHg in the right atrium and 31 mmHg in
     the left brachiocephalic vein (i.e., gradient of 18 mmHg).
     A pressure cuff was insufflated over the upper arm and a venogram was
     repeated. It revealed patency of the arteriovenous anastomosis and the
     brachial artery proximally and distally to the anastomosis with no significant
     stenosis.
                                                                 (Over)

     Thereafter, an 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 471**] wire was placed through the sheath and advanced
     under fluoroscopy until its tip was in the inferior vena cava. The
     micropuncture sheath was exchanged for a 6 French sheath. The focal stenosis
     in the cephalic vein was dilated using a 6 mm X 4 cm balloon. Resolution of
     the narrowing was shown on a follow-up venogram.
     The sheath was removed and a 18 mm X 4 cm balloon was placed over the wire
     into the stenotic SVC and dilated repeatedly under fluoroscopy up to 5
     atmospheres. Follow up venograms through the sidearm of the sheath showed
     significant improvement of the diameter of the SVC. Repeat pressure
     measurements through a 4 French multiside hole straight catheter showed
     complete resolution of pressure gradient across the superior vena cava.
     The catheter and sheath were then removed and local hemostasis was achieved by
     manual compression. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no
     complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS: For conscious sedation, a total of 75 micrograms of Fentanyl was
     given in small divided intravenous doses under continuous hemodynamic
     monitoring. Total of 165 ml IV Optiray 320 dilated by half.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Major, symptomatic stenosis of the superior vena cava. Low-pressure
     balloon venoplasty (18 mm) resulted in highly satisfactory immediate
     angiographic and manometric results.
     
     2.  Focal stenosis in the left cephalic vein at the mid-arm level. This was
     dilated to 6 mm in diameter with no immediate complication.

NPN 7a-7p

Events:  Pt. Pentobarbital gtt decreased from 4mg/kg/hr to 2mg/kg/hr per neurology; plan is to cont. q 1 hour checks on cont. EEG with goal being to show some spikes with pauses for 4-5 seconds indicating appropriate brain activity without sz activity.  Will keep pentobarbital going until tom'row.  Keppra started in addition to dilantin in attempts to suppress sz. activity.  Conts on levophed to maintain MAPs >65.  Sputum perulent with ? pna on CXR; levoflox started.  10mg of lasix given for low u/o.  Wife and two sons in and updated by team.  Need to have family meeting with neurology and SICU teams this week.

Review of Systems:

Neuro-  Pt. remains in pentobarbital coma and is unresponsive.  Pupils are equal and nonreactive.  Although, at 1600 right pupil was mildly/sluggishly reactive to light.  Cont EEG q 1 hour for 1min. conts.  Keppra started in addition to Dilantin.  Dilantin level therapeutic today.  

Resp-  Pt. intubated on [**8-19**] for airway protection.  Now appears to have new pna (GNR per resp. culture) per CXR and sputum.  Sx'ing q 2 hours for thick, yellow secretions requiring ambuing and lavaging.  Sat's down as low as 90% at times when sx'ing required.  ABGs reflective of hypoxemia with PaO2 66, up to 86 and 98 with increase in PEEP.  Last abg reflective of 700X10 PEEP 10 30%; 7.39/44/98/28. Plateau pressure 24. Plan-  aggressive pulm toilet, starting PO levoflox for pna.

CV-  HR 50's low of 48 during stimulation (sx'ing) MAP 60-65 on Levophed currently increased to 0.09mcg/kg/min.  Lasix 10mg given for low u/o.  Pt. remains edemedous with intact skin.  

GI- ABD sl. distended, ? last BM, will persue bowel regimen tom'row if no stool overnoc.  TF increased to goal of 75cc/hr of Promote with fiber.  

GU-  U/O dropping to low of 25cc/hr this afternoon.  IVF stopped and given 10mg of lasix with 200+ cc out in the first hour.  CVP 18-20 not accounting for 10 PEEP.  *** NURSING: FYI when charting i/o pls be aware of volume when accepting defaults on careview... unable to enter the correct concentration for Pentobarbital.  [**Doctor First Name **] have to manually enter correct volume per hour.  

ID-  TMAX 99.0 PO.  Conts on Doxycycline and levoflox added.  CSF viral cx's pending, brain biopsy final results on most specs pending and due back wed.  GNR in sputum from [**8-24**] as mentioned.  Conts on acyclovir for HSV encephalitis.  

Social-  Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 128**] and son in to visit this afternoon followed by another son [**Name (NI) 129**] this afternoon.  Both reporting different information givne from the various members of the consulting teams as well as the SICU team.  this is very concerning and frustrating to the family.  The consulting MDs and SICU TEAM has been very accomodating today and have spoke with each visitor today despite coming in a differnt times.  I think a family meeting with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 130**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 131**] (PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 132**]), Neurology and SICU services present is in order for this week.

Service:  Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient firstname **] [**Known patient lastname 207**] is a
72-year-old male with a past medical history significant for
pancreatic cancer, ulcerative colitis, hypertension, status
post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and
status post total abdominal colectomy 20 years ago with an
end-ileostomy.

The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography recently, but a stent was unable to
be placed.  A computed tomography was performed which
demonstrated a head of the pancreas mass with dilated
intrahepatic duct along with vascular involvement of the
gastroduodenal artery and superior mesenteric vein.  He
presented for exploratory laparotomy with possible pancreatic
mass resection.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Ulcerative colitis.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Total abdominal colectomy with end-ileostomy.
2.  Status post transurethral resection of prostate.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Moexipril 15 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Atenolol 25 mg by mouth once per day.
4.  Allopurinol 300 mg by mouth once per day.
5.  Multivitamin.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient is a thin,
cachectic Caucasian male who was alert and oriented times
three.  In no apparent distress.  The sclerae were anicteric.
The patient was jaundiced.  The oropharynx was clear with
moist mucous membranes.  The neck was supple and without
lymphadenopathy.  The heart was regular in rate and rhythm.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There was a
well-healed midline scar and ileostomy present.  The
extremities were warm without cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  His hematocrit
was 43.2.  His INR was 1.2.  Creatinine was 1.6.  Aspartate
aminotransferase was 51, his alanine-aminotransferase was 89,
his alkaline phosphatase was 395, and his total bilirubin was
12.5.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of admission,
the patient was taken to the operating room where an
exploratory laparotomy was performed.  The patient had
evidence of unresectable pancreatic cancer with biliary
obstruction seen intraoperatively.  Adhesiolysis was
therefore performed along with a Roux-en-Y
hepaticojejunostomy, and open cholecystectomy, an open
pancreatic biopsy, and a gastrojejunostomy.  The estimated
blood loss for the procedure was 250 cc.

The patient was discharged to the regular hospital floor
after being extubated in the Postanesthesia Care Unit in good
condition.

In the evening on postoperative day one, the patient was
taken back to the operating room emergently for likely
mesenteric bleeding.  This was controlled with suture
ligation, and the patient was admitted to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit postoperatively for close monitoring.
The patient remained intubated in the Intensive Care Unit on
pressor support and received total parenteral nutrition until
postoperative day seven.  At this time, the patient's mental
status was extremely labile requiring Haldol for agitation.
The patient's hematocrit was stable at 35.8 at this time.

Tube feeds were initiated on postoperative day eight.  On
postoperative day nine, the patient was transferred to the
regular hospital floor.  At this time, tube feeds were held
for elevated residuals and nausea.  He was still receiving
total parenteral nutrition at this time.  The patient's
mental status was still not completely improved.  A computed
tomography scan was performed on postoperative day ten which
did not demonstrate any intra-abdominal pathology.

The patient was started on sips on postoperative day eleven
and was started on his home medications.  At this time, he
was seen by the Physical Therapy Service and was being
screened for rehabilitation placement.

However, on the evening on postoperative day twelve the
patient spiked a temperature to 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit.  A
fever workup was done including a chest x-ray and blood
cultures.

Early the next morning, the patient was found unresponsive
without a pulse at approximately 2:45 a.m.  At this time, a
code blue was called and advanced cardiac life support
protocol was initiated.  However, the patient was asystolic
without any respiratory effort at this time.  He did receive
multiple rounds of epinephrine along with attempts at
ventilation.  However, the patient never regained electrical
activity and was pronounced deceased at 2:57 a.m.  The
patient's wife was notified at this time.  However, a
postmortem examination was declined.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient expired on [**2876-10-9**].

History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 87 yo M with chronic kidney disease 
s/p AV Graft placement [**9-19**], stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and 
peripheral vascular disease presents with chest pain and 
shortness of breath. He reports that his chest pain began 
approximately one week ago. During the week it has gotten worse. 
It is substernal, radiating to left shoulder, especially with 
inspiration. It is associated with shortness of breath. He came 
to the hospital today because the pain was much worse, [**10-24**]. In 
addition, he noted today black stools. He has been taking iron. 
He reports lightheadedness. Denies nausea, vomiting, 
diaphoresis, arm paresthesias. He has also noticed a cough 
recently but has not been able to produce sputum (though he 
feels congested). 
.
The pt was seen in Geriatric Urgent Care clinic on [**10-29**] for 
dyspnea. He noted worsening in the supine position. An CXR at 
the time to evaluate possible CHF showed "No evidence of 
congestive heart failure or pneumonia. Elevation of the right 
hemidiaphragm".
.
In the ED, the patient was given 80mg IV lasix x 2 with UOP of 
100-200cc. He received nitropaste, lopressor IV and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 791**], and 
morphine, and was started on a nitro gtt. Heparin was started as 
well, and 1 unit PRBCs was transfused. He was given one dose of 
protonix, levofloxacin and . BPs were in the 110s-120s/50s-60s, 
HR 70s-80s. Renal, GI, and cardiology consults were called. The 
patient continued to report [**10-24**] pain, eventually decreased to 
[**7-24**] with titration of the nitro gtt. On arrival in the CCU, he 
still reported [**7-24**] pain. He was on nitro at 120 mcg/min and 
heparin at 850 units/hr.

COMMENTS:      
1. Right heart catheterization revealed elevated right and left 
sided 
pressures. (PCWP = 25 mmhg). 
2. Left heart catheterization revealed no evidence of systolic 
hypertension.  Calculated cardiac output and index were 5.0/2.8. 

3. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system 
revealed 
three vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main coronary 
artery had 
a 40% mid-vessel stenosis.  The left anterior descending artery 
had 
diffuse proximal disease with serial 70-80% stenosis.  The left 
anterior 
descending had mild diffuse disease in the mid and distal 
segments.  The 
large first diagonal had an 80% proximal lesion.  The left 
circumflex 
coronary artery had mild diffuse disease in the proximal, mid, 
and 
distal segments.  There was a subtotal occlusion of the OM1.  
The right 
coronary artery was the dominant vessel.  There was total 
occlusion of 
the right coronary artery in the proximal segment.  The distal 
RCA 
filled via collaterals from the LCA septal branches. 
4. No left ventriculography was undertaken given elevated Cr. 
5. Successful predilation using 2.0 X 12 sprinter balloon and 
stenting 
using a minivision 2.5 X 23 stent of the proximal OM1 with 
lesion 
reduction from 99 to 0% 
6. Successful predilaton using a 2.0 X 20 Maverick balloon and 
stenting 
using 3.0 X 30 Driver stent of the proximal LAD with lesion 
reduction 
from 80% to 0%. 
7. Successful predilation using 2.0 X 12 sprinter balloon and 
stenting 
using a 2.25 X 15 minivision stent of the proximal D1 with 
lesion 
reduction from 80% to 0%. The final angiogram showed TIMI III 
flow in 
the vessels intervened with no residual stenoses in any of the 
stents. 
Thre was no distal embolisation or dissection noted in any 
vessel. 
8. Successful insertion of IABP via right femoral artery. 
( see PTCA comments for the above procdures from 5 through to 8) 

9. At the request of the renal consultants, a 12 French Dialysis 
central 
venous catheter was placed using the Seldinger technique in the 
left 
common femoral vein. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Elevated right and left sided pressures. 
3. Preserved cardiac output/cardiac index. 
4. Successful stenting of the OM, LAD and D1. 
5. Successful insertion of IABP via right femoral artery. 
6. Successful implantation of a central venous dialysis catheter 
in the 
left femoral vein.

         REQUESTED BY DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ON [**3138-11-8**].. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. Rhythm: pt had 2 episodes of monomorphic VT accompanied by 
fall in BP, LOC, terminated x 1 via precordial thumb.  
Electrolytes were repeleted, pt was bolused with Amiodarone x 2, 
and started on an Amio gtt. Amiodarone was then changed to po, 
with a dosing schedule of 400 mg BID for one week, followed by 
400 mg daily for one week, then 200 mg per day.  Monomorphic VT 
thought to be likely due to a fixed area of scarring from 
previous MI.  Placement of an ICD was discussed.  However, given 
the pt's poor prognosis for non sudden cardiac death reasons, 
and given his increased infectious risk, it was decided to treat 
his arrhythmia medically.  Of note, the QT interval was 
prolonged (506), likely secondary to amiodarone.  Patient 
remained in sinus rhythm on Amiodarone.     
2. CAD: Pt with NSTEMI. Cath on [**10-30**] showed 3 vessel disease, 
subsequently underwent successful stenting of OM, D1, LAD and 
IABP placement. IABP was discontinued after the patient was able 
to maintain his own pressure.
Echo completed on [**10-31**], which showed apical akinesis, with 
severely depressed systolic function.  Patient was initially 
started on heparin and bridged to Coumadin, however, he had 
another episode of guaiac positive stool, and given his history 
of melena and coffee ground emesis, the risk for GI bleed was 
thought to be high and anticoagulation was discontinued.
The patient was continued on an aspirin, Statin, beta blocker, 
and was started on an ACE, all of which he will continue as an 
outpatient.  His swan and sheath were discontinued without 
complications.
3.PUMP: CHF: EF 20% by ECHO
He was initially placed on Imdur/Hydral for afterload reduction 
and an ACE was initially avoided in an attempt to salvage his 
kidneys.  However, he was eventually started on low-dose 
lisinopril to be titrated up if necessary.  Patient also 
underwent hemodialysis on Mon/Wed/Fri schedule.
4. Renal: Chronic renal disease, secondary to hypertensive 
nephrosclerosis, is status post graft placement with mature A-V 
graft. Quentin catheter initially used, then discontinued once 
graft accessible.  On [**11-9**], graft noted to be difficult to 
access per renal, patient underwent AV fistulogram, and 
successful angioplasty was performed.  
5. ID: Patient completed a seven day course of levofloxacin for 
suspected pneumonia, white blood count noted to be persistently 
elevated.  Patient was pan cultured, and a urine culture was 
positive for yeast.  Foley catheter was discontinued and a 
repeat culture was sent, also positive for [**Female First Name (un) **].  Patient 
started on a 2 week course of Fluconazole.  Blood cultures 
pending at time of discharge, no growth to date.
6. Heme: anemia, likely anemia of chronic disease from chronic 
renal disease.  Patient also had an episode of melena and coffee 
ground emesis, guaiac positive stool.  Hematocrit was followed, 
and patient was transfused as necessary to keep hematocrit above 
30.  Patient will need GI workup as an outpatient. Oral iron 
supplementation was discontinued as patient receiving Fe in 
addition to EPO and Procrit at hemodialysis
7. DM: Patient was started on glargine for persistent 
hyperglycemia and covered with a regular insulin sliding scale 
with Accu-Check to monitor. 
8. Psych: Patient was continued on his home dose of Zoloft 100 
mg once daily.
Patient tolerated a low Na/cardiac healthy diet and was placed 
on a PPI for GI prophylaxis.
Patient was discharged to rehab facility with plan to follow up 
with cardiology and PCP within the next month.

Date of Birth:                  Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Admitted postoperative for right femoral
popliteal bypass surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71 year-old
male with coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular
disease, who underwent an elective right femoral popliteal
arterial bypass graft on [**2823-12-27**] complicated by
postoperative chest pain with ST depressions in V4 through
V6, which were worsening with the chest pain.  He was seen by
cardiology postoperatively who recommended cycling enzymes.
The third set of CKs became positive and were rising with a
CK of 460 troponin of 22.  At that point electrocardiogram
changes had resolved.  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**2822-12-28**].  On cardiac
catheterization the saphenous vein graft to posterior
descending coronary artery graft showed a distal 95% lesion,
which when crossed with a wire became occluded leading to
fallen blood pressure and cardiogenic shock.  Catheter was
withdrawn, intraaortic balloon pump was placed.  The patient
was intubated.  Catheter accessed then was gained by the left
radial artery and the saphenous vein graft posterior
descending coronary artery was stented, but initially showed
no reflow, but ultimately achieved reflow.  The patient left
the cardiac catheterization laboratory intubated on Dopamine
and Dobutamine as well as Levophed with wide complex
tachycardia, which was thought to be a sinus tachycardia with
apparent conduction or junctional rhythm with systolic blood
pressure in the 90s.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.
3.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2794**] with an saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending coronary artery.  In [**2805**] had a redo
saphenous vein graft posterior descending coronary artery as
well as an saphenous vein graft left circumflex.  In [**2811**] the
patient underwent cardiac catheterization with a total
occlusion of the left circumflex with patent posterior
descending coronary artery graft feeding the left anterior
descending coronary artery via collaterals.  There was no
left internal mammary coronary artery graft.  ETT in [**2821-12-20**] showed an EF of 51% with no evidence of reversible
defects.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease diagnosed in [**2822-1-20**]
status post left iliac stent, recent onset of right
intermittent claudication and an angiogram showing 80% common
femoral artery occlusion.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Diltiazem 90 mg po t.i.d.
2.  Cefazolin.
3.  Lopressor.
4.  Aspirin.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Intravenous Lopressor.
2.  Dobutamine.
3.  Dopamine.
4.  Levophed.
5.  Propofol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER TO THE CORONARY CARE UNIT:
temperature afebrile.  Blood pressure 80 to 110 systolic over
60 to 80 diastolic.  Heart rte in the 130 to 150 range.
Sting 98%.  In general, the patient is sedated and intubated.
HEENT extraocular movements intact.  Pupils are equal, round
and reactive to light and accommodation.  ET tube in place.
Neck right IJ in place.  Lungs rhoncherous throughout all
fields.  Cardiovascular examination tachycardic, normal S1
and S2.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.  Normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities right groin surgical dressing in
place.  Left groin with arterial and venous sheaths in place.
 Right foot is cold.  Left foot is cold.  There is warmth
beginning above the ankle.

LABORATORIES ON TRANSFER:  White blood cell count 20.9,
hematocrit 33.0, platelets 235, INR 1.4, sodium 134,
potassium 4.9, chloride 99, bicarbonate 20, BUN 15,
creatinine 1.0, glucose 385.  Arterial blood gas on admission
7.27, CO2 42, PO2 78, bicarbonate of 20.  Chest x-ray showed
congestive heart failure.  ET tube 68 cm above the carina,
right IJ with swan in [**MD Number 2182**] right, no effusions.  Aortic
balloon pump in place.  Catheterization showed markedly
elevated filling pressures with cardiogenic shock presenting
to laboratory.  Cardiac output 4.41, cardiac index 2.04,
after the intervention changed to an output of 4.58 and an
index of 2.12.  The left heart catheterization showed a right
dominant system with left main with diffuse disease, 80%
distal left main disease with a slow flow in the left
anterior descending coronary artery, right coronary artery
was occluded.  The saphenous vein graft to right coronary
artery with 90% distal stenosis, calcified thrombotic severe.
 Electrocardiograms showed normal sinus rhythm and rate with
normal axis, nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay,
ST depressions in V4 through V6, 2 in AVF.  Post
catheterization there is a wide complex tachycardia at 123
with junctional tachycardia with aberrant conduction, QRS was
172 milliseconds, ST elevations in V2 through V4.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 71 year-old male with coronary
artery disease, diabetes mellitus type two, peripheral
vascular disease admitted to the Coronary Care Unit post
complicated emergent catheterization while in cardiogenic
shock post myocardial infarction arrived to the Coronary Care
Unit on pressors and intubated.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiovascular:  The patient has known
three vessel disease now with a new stent in the saphenous
vein graft, posterior descending coronary artery, which
apparently supplies the bulk of the myocardium given the lack
of flow in the left system, presumably the blood supply by
collaterals now status post right coronary artery stent with
ultimate restoration of flow.  The patient was started on
Plavix, aspirin, Integrilin and was initially unable to start
a beta blocker given the fact that he was on high doses of
multiple pressors including Levophed, Dopamine and
Dobutamine.  Intraaortic balloon pump was also in place for
blood pressure supported perfusion.  On [**2823-12-29**] the
patient was slowly weaned of the Dopamine and the Dobutamine
and had decreasing doses of Propofol and decrease doses of
Levophed with a decreased oxygen requirement.  The aspirin,
Plavix and Atorvastatin were continued.  The patient was
autodiuresing without the need for diuretics or an ace
inhibitor.  At about 3:00 p.m. on [**12-29**] the patient
became more tachycardic with occasional premature ventricular
contractions and then with some runs of 2 to 3 beats.  The
patient then suddenly became tachycardic to 140 and had long
runs of ventricular tachycardia and was shocked multiple
times, transiently regained a pulse, however, degenerated
into V fibrillation and was shocked several times.

At this point the family who was present felt that further
intervention including shock, pressors and ventilatory
support should be discontinued as the patient's original code
status was DNR/DNI, however, the family felt that they wanted
to at least give the patient a chance to see if the coronary
artery reperfusion improved his chances of living.  However,
after seeing that he was now in refractory V fibrillation
they did not want to pursue any further life support
measures.  The code was stopped at 3:57 p.m. at which point
the patient expired.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Cardiopulmonary arrest.
2.  Cardiogenic shock.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Diabetes mellitus.
7.  Status post right femoral popliteal bypass graft on
[**2823-12-27**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Expired.

     placement.
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Comparison is made to study performed one day prior. 
     Nasogastric tube is coiled within the stomach.  There has been interval
     placement of a right femoral approach Swan-Ganz catheter, which likely
     terminates within the main pulmonary artery trunk.  In addition, intraaortic
     balloon pump is in satisfactory position, approximately 5 cm below the aortic
     arch.  There are low lung volumes, cardiomegaly, and persistent interstitial
     edema.  Dense left retrocardiac density is consistent with atelectasis, but
     underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Termination of Swan-Ganz catheter within the main pulmonary artery.
     2.  No significant interval change in mild pulmonary edema and left lower lobe
     atelectasis.

      readjusted PA catheter placement given RV tracing.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
     
     INDICATION:  Dyspnea, end stage renal disease, evolving myocardial infarction
     and cardiogenic shock.  Just re-adjusted position of pulmonary catheter
     placement giving right ventricular pressure tracing.
     
     FINDINGS:  AP single view of the patient in sitting semi-upright position is
     analyzed in direct comparison with a similar preceding study of [**11-1**].
     During the interval, the Swan-Ganz pulmonary catheter approached from below
     has been removed.  On previous examination, bilateral mostly centrally located
     pulmonary densities have regressed some slightly and demonstrate improvement
     of the edema pattern.  No new parenchymal infiltrates are identified.
     
     The position of the Swan-Ganz catheter tip on the preceding study was just at
     the level of the pulmonary valve.  Consequently the possibility that the
     catheter tip still remaining in the outflow tract of the right ventricle is
     apparent. Secure position of PA catheters could have the distal 2-3 cm at
     least in the proximal portion of the right main stem or the left main stem.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Removal of Swan-Ganz catheter.  No pneumothorax.  Edema pattern.

     INDICATION:  64-year-old woman with necrotizing pancreatitis.  Please evaluate
     for intra-abdominal pathology.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior study performed on [**3430-8-12**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from lung bases to pubic symphysis
     after administration of 130 cc of Optiray intravenously.  Oral contrast was
     also used.  Sagittal and coronal reformatted images were acquired.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:
     The visualized portion of the lung bases demonstrates stable appearnce of
     multiple foci of loculated effusion and atelectasis of the base of left lung.
     Small amount of right pleural effusion is noted.  The visualized portion of
     the right lung is unremarkable.  The end of CV line is noted within the distal
     SVC.  The visualized portion of the aortic stent is unchanged. Multiple
     surgical clips are noted near the diaphragmatic crura.
     
     
     Peripancreatic inflammation is stable. Localized areas of fluid collection
     surrounding the pancreas (anterior border of the pancreatic head, near the
     pancreatic tail and inferior to the pancreatic head) are unchanged. A drainage
     tube starting the pancreatic bed and ending in the right upper quadrant area
     is also noted.
     
     Th liver contains multiple small hypodense lesions which are too small to
     characterize. The gallbladder contains a large gallstone with no evidence of
     cholecystitis. The intra and extrahepatic bile ducts are normal. The spleen,
     adrenal glands, small bowel and large bowel loops appear unremarkable. Patient
     is status post PEG tube placement.  Both kidneys contains multiple hypodense
     lesions, some of which most likely represents cysts, however, some of these
     lesions do not have the appearance of a simple cyst.
     
     The large ventral defect of the anterior abdominal wall is unchanged. The
     small amount of gas tracking from the wound into the peritoneal space is
     unchanged. Foci of soft tissue density within the anterior abdominal fat are
     likely related to the injection sites.  No pathologically enlarged
     retroperitoneal or mesenteric nodes are noted.  No free air or fluid is noted
     within the abdomen and pelvis.

     BONE WINDOWS:  No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.  
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Status post necrotizing pancreatitis with a stable appearance of peri-
     pancreatic inflammation and  pockets of fluid accumulation.
     
     2) Stable appearance of the loculated effusions of the left lung bases.
     
     3) Bilateral kidney cysts, some of which do not have the characteristics of

      87 year old man with HD fistula, placed ~1 month ago, previously able to HD but 
      now +thrill but difficulty accessing.  [**Hospital Unit Name 3017**] recommends AV graft dye study.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Evaluate patency, flow of AV graft                                              
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     HISTORY:  87-year-old man with hemodialysis graft in the right upper extremity
     with no thrill, difficult access, and bounding pulse.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3018**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1883**], Attending Radiologist, present
     and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table
     after appropriate consent was obtained.  The right arm was prepped and draped
     in sterile fashion.  The graft was accessed with a 21-gauge needle after 1%
     lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.  The 0.018 guidewire was advanced
     toward the central venous circulation and the needle was exchanged for a 4.5-
     French introducer sheath.  Venogram performed with and without placement of a
     tourniquet over the axillary vein demonstrated tight venous stenosis
     immediately adjacent to the anastomosis between the graft and the brachial
     vein.  Based on the diagnostic findings, it was decided that the patient was a
     good candidate for and would benefit from angioplasty.  0.035 [**Last Name (un) 1477**] wire was
     placed into the sheath and the sheath was exchanged for a 5- French
     angiographic sheath. 6 mm, 2 cm, and 8 mm, 4 cm balloons were used for
     sequential balloon dilatation of the venous stenosis. A followup venogram
     demonstrated substantial improvement in the luminal diameter of the brachial
     veins adjacent to the graft-to-vein anastomosis.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  No immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Angiogram of the AV graft in the right arm demonstrated tight
     stenosis of the brachial vein adjacent to the graft-to-vein anastomosis.
     Angioplasty with 6 mm and 8 mm none-cutting balloons was performed with good
     results.

      now +thrill but difficulty accessing.  [**Hospital Unit Name 3017**] recommends AV graft dye study.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Evaluate patency, flow of AV graft

     HISTORY:  87-year-old man with hemodialysis graft in the right upper extremity
     with no thrill, difficult access, and bounding pulse.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3018**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1883**], Attending Radiologist, present
     and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table
     after appropriate consent was obtained.  The right arm was prepped and draped
     in sterile fashion.  The graft was accessed with a 21-gauge needle after 1%
     lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.  The 0.018 guidewire was advanced
     toward the central venous circulation and the needle was exchanged for a 4.5-
     French introducer sheath.  Venogram performed with and without placement of a
     tourniquet over the axillary vein demonstrated tight venous stenosis
     immediately adjacent to the anastomosis between the graft and the brachial
     vein.  Based on the diagnostic findings, it was decided that the patient was a
     good candidate for and would benefit from angioplasty.  0.035 [**Last Name (un) 1477**] wire was
     placed into the sheath and the sheath was exchanged for a 5- French
     angiographic sheath. 6 mm, 2 cm, and 8 mm, 4 cm balloons were used for
     sequential balloon dilatation of the venous stenosis. A followup venogram
     demonstrated substantial improvement in the luminal diameter of the brachial
     veins adjacent to the graft-to-vein anastomosis.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  No immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Angiogram of the AV graft in the right arm demonstrated tight
     stenosis of the brachial vein adjacent to the graft-to-vein anastomosis.
     Angioplasty with 6 mm and 8 mm none-cutting balloons was performed with good
     results.

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     CLINICAL HISTORY: 78 year old female with myelodysplastic syndrome, now with
     hypotension and left flank pain and bruising.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung bases through
     the symphysis pubis prior to and following the administration of 150 cc of
     Optiray. Nonionic contrast was used due to patient allergy history.
     
     COMPARISON: None available.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The visualized lung bases
     demonstrate small left pleural effusion with associated atelectatic changes.
     Patient has undergone cholecystectomy. The liver, pancreas, and adrenal glands
     appear grossly normal. There is splenomegaly, with an approximate splenic size
     of 16.8 cm. The spleen is diffusely heterogeneous, with evidence of more focal
     lesions. However, evaluation is limited do to the early timing of the contrast
     bolus. There is a 5.6 x 5.7 cm bilobed right renal cyst. Both kidneys are
     otherwise unremarkable. Stomach and proximal loops of small and large bowel
     are unremarkable. There are a few prominent but nonpathologically enlarged
     left paraaortic and mesenteric lymph nodes. The aorta and its major branches
     are widely patent. There is no free fluid or air within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder is
     distended but is otherwise unremarkable. Patient appears to have undergone
     hysterectomy. Pelvic loops of bowel are grossly within normal limits. There is
     no free fluid.
     
     BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes of the mid thoracic spine are noted. No
     suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. No evidence of intra or retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
     2. Splenomeglay as above with increased heterogeneity and possible focal
     splenic lesions. Given the timing of the contrast [**Last Name (LF) 12614**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ultrasound is
     recommended for further evaluation.
     3. Small left pleural effusion and associated atelectatic changes.

     HRC # 9580.  Room 317 North.
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Increased white cell count and fever.
     
     CHEST AP:
     The heart is enlarged with left ventricular prominence.  The left lung field
     is clear.
     
     In the right lower lobe some increased opacity is seen, suggesting atelectasis
     and probably some infiltrate in this region.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Probable right lower lobe pneumonia.

     INDICATION:  Fever.
     
     The heart size is normal but demonstrates left ventricular configuration. 
     Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits allowing for supine positioning.
     There is marked elevation of the right hemidiaphragm which is increased in
     degree of elevation since the previous radiograph.  Adjacent opacity is noted
     in the middle and lower lobe.  The presence of volume loss favors atelectasis.
     Additional patchy opacity is seen in the left retrocardiac region, and may be
     due to atelectasis or pneumonia.  Followup radiographs are suggested.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Mental status change in the setting of septic shock with probable
     liver abscesses.  Evaluate for abscess.
     
     COMPARISON:  MRI and MRA of the brain dated [**3132-9-27**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the head was performed without additional administration of
     IV contrast.  The patient received 150 cc of IV Optiray contrast earlier on
     the day of the exam for an abdomen/pelvis study.  Thus, the extent of
     enhancement of normal vascular structures is limited.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are no definite areas of acute intracranial hemorrhage,
     although prior contrast administration limits the evaluation.  There is no
     shift of the normally midline structures.  The ventricles and cisterns are
     unchanged from prior study, noted above.  Hypodensity of the white matter of
     the left occipital lobe as well as bilateral periventricular white matter
     within each cerebral hemisphere is consistent with chronic microvascular
     infarction, and appears to be unchanged from [**3132-9-14**], as seen on this
     prior MRI exam. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
     clear.
     
     The scout image demonstrates mild anterolisthesis of C3 on C4, likely
     degenerative in origin.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Probably unchanged appearance of the brain compared to September
     1999.  There are areas of chronic microvascular ischemia/infarction in both
     cerebral hemispheres. There are no definite abscesses identified, although the
     exam is slightly limited as IV contrast was administered several hours prior
     to the performance of this study.

     INDICATION:  87-year-old man with gram positive sepsis, question abscess.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis from [**3137-12-6**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning was performed from the level of the lung
     bases to the level of the pubic symphysis after the administration of IV and
     oral contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  Bilateral small pleural effusions are seen, right greater
     than left.  A partially calcified pleural plaque is seen along the right
     anterior pleural surface.  There are dependent changes in the lung bases
     bilaterally.  The visualized heart and pericardium appear unremarkable.  In
     the liver are multiple new low-density lesions, the largest of which in
     segment 8 measures 5.1 x 3.6 cm.  Again seen is a calcified gallstone in the
     neck of the gallbladder, without evidence of gallbladder wall thickening or
     pericholecystic fluid.  The spleen has a mottled appearance to it with
     possible areas of hypodensity, but does not have discrete measurable lesions
     within it.  The adrenal glands and pancreas appear unremarkable.  There is a
     small amount of perihepatic ascites as well as fluid within the left paracolic
     gutter.  The opacified loops of small bowel appear normal in caliber and
     contour.  The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically, and have
     unchanged surrounding non-specific fat stranding. Stable multiple rounded
     hypodensities are seen in the kidneys bilaterally, which are incompletely
     characterized on this study, but likely represent simple cysts. Included in
     these is a 1.9-cm left parapelvic cyst.
     
     The colonic wall is diffusely edematous from the cecum to the rectum.  A 1.9 x
     2.3 x 3.7-cm ovoid opacity is seen adjacent to the ascending colon, with clear
     tissue planes between it and the colon as well as the right kidney.  There is
     atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta and its major branches, but the major
     arteries and veins appear patent. There is no pathologic mesenteric or
     retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  There is no free air within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS:  A Foley catheter is seen within the urinary bladder, with
     some air within the bladder lumen.  The prostate and seminal vesicles appear
     unremarkable.  Again seen is the colonic wall edema extending to the rectum.
     There is an extensive amount of free fluid within the pelvis.  Two fluid
     collections are identified in the left inguinal region, measuring 1.8 and 1.8
     cm respectively.  The distal aortic bypass graft is again identified. There is
                                                                 (Over)

     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Pancolitis extending from the rectum to the cecum.  Given this patient's
     recent antibiotic use, infectious etiologies are of concern.  Likely enlarged
     lymph node adjacent to the ascending colon, though a small abscess in this
     region is possible though less likely.
     2.  Multiple hypodensities of varying sizes within the liver are concerning
     for abscesses in this patient with bacteremia.  Additionally, there is a
     mottled appearance to the spleen which may indicate splenic involvement.
     3.  Ascites and large amount of free fluid within the pelvis.  Two small fluid
     collections in the left inguinal region are likely postoperative in nature
     given recent instrumentation.
     4.  Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION
PROCEDURE:      
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry 
of the 
right femoral vein, using a 7 French pulmonary wedge pressure 
catheter, 
advanced to the PCW position through a 8 French introducing 
sheath. 
Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method. 
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry 
of the 
right femoral artery, using a 6 French right [**Last Name (un) 1414**] catheter, 
advanced 
to the ascending aorta through a 6 French introducing sheath. 
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections 
using a 6 
French XBLAD 3.5 and a 6 French JR4 catheter, with manual 
contrast 
injections. 
Visualization of the left coronary artery was repeated after the 
i.c. 
administration of 50 mcg of nitroglycerine. 
Percutaneous coronary revascularization was performed using 
placement of 
drug-eluting stent(s). 
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring 
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

PTCA COMMENTS:      
  We elected to treat the totally occluded proximal LAD with 
PTCA/Stenting using heparin and integrilin prophylactically.  A 
Choice 
PTXS wire crossed into the LAD with significant difficulty (a 
Wizdom SS 
wire and several PT Graphix Intermediate wires would not cross). 
 A 2.5 
x 15 mm Voyager was used to predilate in five inflations at 8-9 
atm.  An 
export catheter would not cross beyond the proximal LAD, but 
suctioning 
of this area resulted in minor improvement in flow. A 2.5 x 24 
mm Taxus 
DES was deployed proximally and into the mid-LAD at 12 atm, and 
another 
2.5 x 24 mm Taxus DES was deployed in overlapping fashion more 
distally 
at 12 atm.  The second SDS was used to post-dilate the overlap 
area at 
18 atm.  There was significant spasm and no-reflow in the 
[**Last Name (LF) 11371**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 
intracoronary nitroglycerin and nitroprusside were adminstered 
through 
the guide, and more intracoronary nitroprusside was administered 
through 
the lumen of a 2.0 x 30 mm Maverick positioned just distal to 
the second 
stent. 
  Final angiography demonstrated no dissection, no residual 
stenosis 
within the stented segments with loss of a major diagonal branch 
(closed 
at the start of the case), and TIMI-3 flow into a diffusely 
diseased 
distal LAD.

COMMENTS:      
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant 
system 
with two vessel CAD.  The left main had mild disease.  The LAD 
had a 70% 
lesion at it's origin and a 100% proximal occlusion.  The left 
circumlfex artery had a 70% lesion in the OM1 branch.  The RCA 
had mild 
disease. 
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated right and 
left 
sided filling pressures with a mean RA pressure of 24 mm Hg and 
mean 
PCWP of 31 mm Hg.  Moderate pulmonary hypertension was present.  
The 
cardiac index was markedly reduced, based on an assumed oxygen 
consumption index.  Central aortic pressure was normal. 
3. Left ventriculography was not performed. 
4. Successful PCI of the LAD with two overlapping Taxus DES (2.5 
x 24 mm 
and 2.5 x 24 mm). 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Markedly reduced cardiac index with elevated left and right 
sided 
filling pressures but normal central aortic pressure. 
3. Acute anterior STEMI treated with primary PCI.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, and no known CAD.  She presented to the 
emergency 
department with dyspnea.  ECG demonstrated anterior STEMI.  
After a 
discussion with the patient's nephew, the patient was brought to 
the 
catheterization laboratory where she was found to have occlusion 
of the LAD with 80% stenosis at OM1.  She had a cypher stent 
placed to the LAD.  She was found to have a low cardiac index 
with low mvo2 during catheterization.  She was diuresed 1 liter 
over the course of her hospitalization which she tolerated well, 
and resulted in marked improvement in her oxygenation.  
Hospitalization was complicated by increased bleeding at access 
site after catheterization, for which hemostasis was eventually 
obtained but integrellin was discontinued early.  Her hematocrit 
remained stable.  As post MI echo showed akinesis, pt was 
started on coumadin for a 6 month course after determining she 
was not a fall risk with physical therapy and with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] 
was also found to have a UTI for which she was treated with 
Levaquin.

was a well-dressed male thought to be in his 30s without any 
evidence of track marks or drug use. His pupils were dilated. He 
was intubated in the field. He was found in PEA arrest. 
According to rhythm strips obtained from EMS, his first rhythm 
was sinus bradycardia and he was given epinephrine and atropine. 
He then went into WCT followed by MMVT. He was then shocked with 
200 J and rhythm became PMVT and was shocked for the second time 
with 300 J. He then went into ST and recovery of pulse. He 
received a total of 2 mg of epinephrine and 2 mg of atropine 
with 2 shocks (200 and 300J). He was then transported to [**Hospital1 19**] 
ED.
.
In the ED, his pupils were fixed and dilated B/L. FAST was 
negative. CXR revealed distended stomach. CT of head, chest,

Imaging Studies:
1. CXR [**2993-7-25**]
The ET tube tip is positioned approximately 2 cm from the 
carina. There has been interval placement of an OG tube, 
extending beyond the GE junction, though the tip is not 
visualized on this study. The cardiac and the mediastinal 
contours are within normal limits. The lungs are clear. No 
pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen. The soft tissue and 
osseous structures are stable in appearance.
IMPRESSION: The OG tube extends beyond the GE junction, though 
the tip is not visualized on this image.
.
2. CT Head, C-spine, Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis W/Contrast
The study is limited secondary to motion. No definite hemorrhage 
is identified.
No fracture or subluxation.
No evidence of traumatic injury.
.
3. Echo [**2993-7-26**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and  
cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is mildly depressed with mild global hypokinesis more 
prominent in the distal inferior, distal septal and apical 
segments. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with 
good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion. EF 45%
.
4. EEG [**2993-7-26**]
This is a markedly abnormal electroencephalogram due to the 
presence of a suppressed background interrupted by rhythmic 
sharply 
contoured and evolving epileptiform activity. This EEG is 
consistent 
with brief periods of electrographic seizures on a suppressed 
background. The team was called and notified of this result. 
.
5. EEG [**2993-7-29**]
This is an abnormal 24 hour bedside telemetry due to the 
presence of a low voltage, diffusely slow background activity. 
This 
suppressed activity may be seen with diffuse subcortical 
dysfunction, as 
occurs with CNS depressant medications or diffuse cerebral 
ischemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
28 y/o male with no known PMH at the time found down s/p cardiac 
arrest. PEA then VT then VF. Successful resuscitation with 2 
shocks. The patient suffered anoxic brain injury s/p cardiac 
arrest.
.
1. s/p cardiac arrest
The patient was initially found down in [**Location (un) 1194**]. Please 
see above HPI for further details. After arriving at [**Hospital1 19**] ED, 
he was ruled out for any traumatic injury. He was then 
transferred to the CCU for further evaluation and management 
after his cardiac arrest. Due to his recent VF arrest, the 
hypothermia protocol was initiated and the patient was cooled 
for 18 hours. GCS before protocol was initiated was 3. The 
patient met all inclusion criteria and he had none of the 
exclusion criteria. Following the cooling protocol, he was 
re-warmed. Upon initial arrival to the CCU, his EKG was analyzed 
for any evidence of arrhythmia or abnormality that would explain 
his cardiac arrest. Echocardiogram was performed soon after the 
patient arrived in the CCU which was negative for any structural 
abnormality of the heart. See full echo report above for 
details. Initial tox screen was positive for opiates and benzos. 
The leading diagnosis after cardiac causes were ruled out were 
possible substance abuse causing respiratory suppression then 
hypoxia which may have induced the cardiac arrest. Since the 
patient was never awake from presentation, obtaining any HPI was 
impossible. After talking with his family, they mentioned that 
he had a history of substance abuse and was most likely using 
heroin and/or benzos prior to being found down. The exact 
etiology of what caused the patient's cardiac arrest remained 
uncertain. Due to the patient's anoxic brain injury and after 
consulting neurology, the family decided to withdraw support on 
[**2993-7-31**] and the patient expired soon afterwards. 
.
2. Anoxic brain injury
After the patient was transferred to the CCU, neurology was 
consulted so they could perform an exam while patient was off 
sedation prior to initiating cooling protocol. Upon arrival to 
the CCU, the patient was having myoclonic jerking which was more 
consistent with anoxic brain injury than seizure activity. 
Neurology recommended EEG and then continued EEG monitoring. On 
initial exam, the patient did have a gag reflex and corneal 
reflexes. However, as his hospital course progressed, all of his 
reflexes were absent, even off sedation for 48 hours. He was 
monitored continuously with EEG which showed no signs of 
activity. He was maintained initially on Dilantin to control any 
seizures secondary to anoxic brain injury and that was 
eventually discontinued. Organ bank saw the patient and 
determined that he was not a suitable candidate for organ 
donation. During the last two days of the patient's 
hospitalization, he began to show evidence of multi-organ 
failure and required pressor support to maintain his BP. After 
several discussions with the family, CCU team, and neurology, it 
was communicated that the patient would never return to normal 
functioning. The family decided in complete agreement to 
withdraw support on [**2993-7-31**] and the patient passed away soon 
after the night of the 16th at 21:15. The family declined 
autopsy.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     35-year-old male found down with PEA arrest with concern for neck injury.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT contiguously acquired axial images of the chest, abdomen, and
     pelvis were obtained after 130 mL Optiray IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
     reformatted images were also obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The heart and great vessels of the chest
     opacify well.  There is no evidence of aortic aneurysm, dissection, pulmonary
     embolism, or mediastinal hematoma.  The heart and pericardium are
     unremarkable.  There is no pathologic mediastinal, axillary, or hilar
     lymphadenopathy.  Lung windows demonstrate mild posterior dependent
     atelectatic changes but otherwise the lungs are clear without pneumothorax or
     pleural effusion.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen,
     adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable.  The stomach is distended with
     gas.  There is no free intra-abdominal air or fluid.  There is no pathologic
     lymphadenopathy.

     35-year-old male found down with PEA arrest with concern for neck injury.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT contiguously acquired axial images of the chest, abdomen, and
     pelvis were obtained after 130 mL Optiray IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
     reformatted images were also obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The heart and great vessels of the chest
     opacify well.  There is no evidence of aortic aneurysm, dissection, pulmonary
     embolism, or mediastinal hematoma.  The heart and pericardium are
     unremarkable.  There is no pathologic mediastinal, axillary, or hilar
     lymphadenopathy.  Lung windows demonstrate mild posterior dependent
     atelectatic changes but otherwise the lungs are clear without pneumothorax or
     pleural effusion.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen,
     adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable.  The stomach is distended with
     gas.  There is no free intra-abdominal air or fluid.  There is no pathologic
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The rectum, prostate, seminal vesicles,
     and urinary bladder are unremarkable.  There is no free pelvic fluid.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No fracture or suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion is

     The vertebral body heights and intervertebral disc spaces are preserved.  The
     patient is intubated, and the tip was positioned within the lower trachea.
     There is no definite prevertebral soft tissue swelling.  There is limited
     evaluation of intrathecal contents on CT, however, the contour of the thecal
     sac is within normal limits.  There is no significant spinal canal or neural
     foraminal narrowing.  Within the limited visualized portion of the lung
     apices, no pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.  There are ill-defined
     hazy opacities in right and left lung apices, which may represent areas of
     atelectasis and/or aspiration.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No fracture or subluxation.

Intubated in the field, found to be bradycardic, given atropine and epi, then WCT-> VT shicked with 200j->PMVT shocked with 300j-> into sinus rhytham with pulse. Labs sent in ED including tox screen-> negative, Ph 7.08, with a lactate 7.7. Began to cool down with cool packs. Transfered to CCU for Artic Sun cooling treatment. On arrival to CCU echo done to rule out any cardiac history-> NAD. Sedation off for short while prior to cooling so neuro team could review, who will follow. Re-sedated and paralysed and cooling treatmant started at 2200, goal temperature 32-34 dgrees C. Police also visited to take finger prints to help identify him, as no form of identification on him.

RESP:- Orally intubated and ventilated on A/C 600/16/+5 Fi02 35%. Inital ABGs showed acidoisis which improved with vent adjustments, 0200 ABG 7.37/31/213. Suctioned for small amount of secretions. Bilateral air entry heard to all lungfields. Oral airway inplace to stop from biting on tube(prior to paralysing).

CV:- Initially moniotred in sinus tachycardia rate 90-110bpm, with very rare ectopics, rate nows in the 60s' since cooling. A-line placed on warding, SBP initially 150s-170s' again improved with sedation and cooling, now 110-120s, MAP 60s'. Artic sun started at 2200. Peripherally warm to touch prior to treatment now cool all over. Pedal pulses weakly palpable. Hct 40, Hgb 14.2 in ED, for repeat labs at 0600. Magnesium and phospate repleated. K+3.8. SQ heparin Q8 hour.

NEURO:- Sedated on propofol at 30mcg/kg/min and paralysed on vecuronium at 0.03mg/kg/hr, rate had to be reduced for the ordered 0.05/kg/hr as were unable to obtain TOF. TOF intially found by tragus, but post cooling difficult to find, despite trying at different sites on body and at different voltages. Appears comfortable, no physiolgical signs of pain/awareness of the situation.Has impaired cough and gag reflex, but corneal reflex present. On warding did freequent jerking/twitching movements, this was seen by neuro team, who reviewed, but could not offer anything else apart from continue with propofol sedation,  but they will continue to follow.

GU:- Foley catheter draining good amounts of clear yellow urine. BUN 16 and creatinine 1.2.

GI:- OG tube placed in ED, position confirmed in the ED, position checked and air heard onauscletation. Minimal residuals. Adbomen soft and non tender. Bowel sounds herad. Bowels not moved overnight. PPI started for gastric protection.

SKIN:- Has ? old burn scars on lt wrist and rt inner foot, along with small pin prick marks on thumbs and a blister in the webbing of rt hand, burst by dr, tripple antibiotic cream applied and dressing to cover. Also has various tattoos on body. Pressure areas intact. [**Location (un) 82**] J collar inplace, remains flat on bed, until neck is cleared by team. Log rolls.

Service:  C MEDICINE

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old female
with a past medical history of coronary artery disease,
status post CABG, ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 20%,
status post left parietal CVA, and bilateral carotid aortic
stenosis, status post left CEA, who was transferred from an
outside hospital for right carotid artery stenting.

At the outside hospital, the patient was treated for CHF
exacerbation with successful diuresis.  Her hospital course
at that time was complicated by nausea, vomiting, with
elevated alkaline phosphatase and GGT status post right upper
quadrant ultrasound without evidence of stones or ductal
dilatation with trace ascites.  GI was consulted with
assessment of CHF versus possible gastritis.

A second complication included right MTP ulcers, status post
debridement.  No evidence of osteomyelitis.  This was treated
with Keflex for a ten day course.

The next issue included acute on chronic renal failure with
creatinine peak at 2.8, BUN 71.  Renal consult for this felt
that it was believed to be due to worsened CHF.

On presentation, the patient reported minimal shortness of
breath with significant fatigue and weakness.  She denied
chest pain, abdominal pain, orthopnea, PND, or fever and
chills.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Pertinent for chronic nausea for weeks
with intermittent vomiting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post CABG in [**3418**].
2.  Status post catheterization in [**3423-10-28**] with
patent graft.
3.  Ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 22% with basal mid
inferior, posterior hypokinesis.
4.  Bilateral carotid artery stenosis, status post left CEA.
5.  Left parietal CVA.
6.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
7.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
8.  Hypercholesterolemia.
9.  Hypertension.
10. Status post cholecystectomy and total abdominal
hysterectomy.
11. GERD, positive H. pylori.

ALLERGIES:  Question of an ACE inhibitor causing RTA.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix 160 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Zaroxolyn 5 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Nitroglycerin paste two inches q. six hours.
4.  Coreg 12.5 mg b.i.d.
5.  Hydralazine 25 mg p.o. q.i.d.
6.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 123**] 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d.

10. ECASA 81 mg p.o. q.d.
11. Zoloft 25 mg p.o. q.d.
12. Bactroban cream b.i.d. to feet.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  She has a prior
tobacco history of 40 plus years for one to two packs per
day, quit a month ago.  Denied ethanol or illicit drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
98.0, BP 142/56, heart rate 50, respiratory rate 22, SP02 93%
on 2 liters.  General:  The patient was in no acute distress,
a pleasant female who appeared chronically ill.  HEENT:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Surgical left pupil.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Moist mucous membranes.  Clear oropharynx.
Neck:  Supple, no lymphadenopathy, positive JVP.  Pulmonary:
Decreased breath sounds one-fourth of the way up on the
right.  No wheeze.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm
with S3 and a II/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal
border.  Abdomen:  Soft, obese, bowel sounds positive,
positive hepatomegaly.  Extremities:  No edema.  The right
MTP revealed a shallow-based ulcer, 1+ DP pulses on the
right.  The left MTP showed a healing ulcer, 1+ DP pulses on
the left.  Neurological:  The patient was awake, alert, and
oriented.  Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  The
patient was noted to be diffusely weak, right upper extremity
[**5-1**], deltoid, biceps, triceps, sensation diminished to light
and pinprick, stocking glove distribution.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA/STUDIES:  The EKG showed sinus
bradycardia at 52 beats per minute with leftward axis.  There
were T wave inversions in the anterolateral leads and [**Street Address 287**]
depression also in the anterolateral leads which were
unchanged from [**3424-3-10**].

The admission laboratories were pertinent for a hematocrit of
32.4.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.6, chloride 87, bicarbonate
40, BUN 60, creatinine 2.6, glucose 69.

Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and mild failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service and ruled out for a myocardial infarction.  She
continued diuresis until her baseline weight.  The day after
admission, the patient underwent stenting and PTA of the
right ICA with good results.

Post procedure, the patient had a hematocrit drop and was
given 1 unit of packed red blood cells to return to greater
than 30.  Also, postoperatively, the patient had episodes of
bradycardia to the 40s.  This was due to the procedure being
near the carotid body.  She was asymptomatic when this rate
drops.  Also of note, the patient's creatinine increased to
3.4.

The patient appeared intravascularly depleted and she was
given IV fluid hydration.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Right internal carotid artery stenosis, status post
stent.
2.  Chronic renal failure.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to home with VNA
Services.  Of note, the patient refused rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Pyracin calcium 2% cream applied topically b.i.d.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left vertebral artery origin stenosis. 
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same status post stent angioplasty of the left
     vertebral artery origin.
     
     ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia.
     
     INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7289**] is a 69-year-old man who was found to
     have a left vertebral artery critical stenosis as well as bilateral carotid
     artery disease. He is status post carotid endarterectomy and is now slated to
     undergo treatment of his vertebral origin stenosis.
     
     CONSENT: The patient and his family was given a full and complete explanation
     of the procedure. Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits, and
     alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail. In addition, the
     possible complications, such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death, were outlined. The
     patient and his family understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought into the Endovascular Suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The left groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 19-gauge single-wall needle was then
     used to puncture the left common femoral artery, and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 7 French vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and
     kept on a heparinized saline drip. Next, a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels: left subclavian artery, left
     vertebral artery. After obtaining access and placement of a guidecatheter into
     the left vertebral artery an angiogrphic run was performed. The patient was
     administered heparinization to achieve an activated clotting time of 250
     seconds. He was then pretreated with plavix and aspirin. At this point a
     microwire was used to cross the critical stenosis and subsequently a 2 mm x 9
     mm Maverick over-the-wire balloon was used to perform angioplasty of the
     origin of the left vertebral artery. The balloon was then withdrawn and an AVE

                                     FINAL REPORT
     (Cont)
     S670 4 mm x 9 mm was used to perform angioplasty at the origin of the left
     vertebral artery. The balloon was then removed and angiographic run was
     performed through the left subclavian artery with the wire crossing the left
     vertebral artery. This showed no evidence of dissection and a good
     angiographic result with complete resolution of the stenosis at the left
     vertebral artery origin. Small portion of the stent is seen to extend into the
     left subclavian artery. However this does not represent any consequence in
     terms of flow limitation and is unavoidable in order to perform adequate
     angioplasty of the stenotic segment. At this point the microwire was removed
     from the left vertebral artery and an angiographic run was performed of the
     left subclavian artery which showed excellent improvement in the stenosis in
     the antegrade flow. Angiographic run of the intracranial portion of the left
     vertebral artery showed a patent basilar artery and patent bilateral posterior
     cerebral and bilateral superior cerebellar artery in the right-sided ICA
     vessel with a left-sided ICA-PICA vessel. There is a little bit of retrograde
     reflux into the right vertebral artery which was previously documented to be
     occluded proximally. At this point the guidecatheter was withdrawn from the
     patient and an angiographic run was performed of the iliac artery which
     appears to be heavily calcified and hypotrophied and accordingly a manual
     compression was used later to remove the sheath. Patient did well
     neurologically and was transferred to intensive care unit in stable condition.
     
     IMPRESSION: Critical left vertebral artery origin stenosis treated using
     primary angioplasty followed by stent angioplasty with significant improvement
     in left vertebral artery flow.

Service:


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man
with a history of peptic ulcer disease, coronary artery
disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2547**] as well as
2003, temporal arteritis, who presented with melenas  and
chest pain. The patient reported melanotic stools times 5
since 4 p.m. on the day prior to admission. No hematemesis or
hematochezia. Stools were loose. The patient had a history of
melena in [**2561-2-16**]. The patient also reported being
lightheaded, fatigued with an increase in his ch set
discomfort for which he was taking sublingual nitroglycerin
with relief. On the a.m. of presentation, the symptoms
persisted; the patient contacted his PCP who sent him to the
ED. In the ED, the p was found to have a hematocrit of 22.9
decreased from a baseline of 32 to 38. He was given IV
Protonix, IV fluids, and transfused the first of 2 units of
packed red blood cells. Gastroenterology was consulted. The
patient initially had an EKG with slight inferior changes
while the patient was pain free. The patient then had an
episode of 8/10 substernal chest pain in the ED with 3 to [**Street Address 4568**] changes in V3 to V4.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for upper gastrointestinal
bleed in [**2561-2-16**]. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed an
ulcer in the pylorus and chronic gastritis, coronary artery
disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2547**] and 2003,
benign prostatic hypertrophy, history of temporal arteritis,
pemphigoid, history of anemia, history of small bowel
volvulus, status post appendectomies, status post inguinal
hernia repair x2, history of colonic polyps, and sigmoid
diverticulosis.

ALLERGIES:  THE PATIENT HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

MEDICATIONS:  The patient was on:

1. Celebrex.
2. Aspirin.
3. Prednisone.
4. Atenolol.
5. Imdur.
6. Nitroglycerin p.r.n.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a retired physician, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 4569**].
Remote tobacco history. Social alcohol use, which is
infrequent. Married with 1 son.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION AS FOLLOWS:  VITAL SIGNS:
Vital signs of 98.9 temperature, blood pressure 128/80, pulse
72, respiratory rate of 13, and oxygen 100% on 3 liters.
GENERAL: The patient appeared comfortable.
HEENT: Examination was unremarkable except for pale
conjunctiva, dry mucosa.

LABORATORY DATA:  Significant for the hematocrit of 23 as
stated above, a potassium of 5.3, a BUN 78. Initial CK was
107 with an MB of 6 and a troponin of 0.02. INR was 1.0.
Urinalysis was unremarkable. As stated above, the patient had
2 EKGs and the second of which showed 2 to [**Street Address 4570**] changes in
V3 to V6. Chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary
process, so the patient was admitted to the hospital.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE AS FOLLOWS:  GI: The
patient was felt to likely have another bleeding ulcer as the
etiology of his melanotic stools and anemia. The patient had
a history of Helicobacter pylori in the past that was
treated. The patient was felt to require EGD to evaluate for
recurrent infection as well as ongoing bleeding. The patient
was initially admitted to the ICU. Gastroenterology was
consulted. The patient was taken for EGD on [**3-18**], which
showed a deep antral ulcer, no acute bleeding. The ulcer was
injected.

The patient was initially continued on IV b.i.d. Protonix.
Hematocrits were followed and the patient was maintained on 2
peripheral IV's at all times, and aspirin was held. The
patient has another episode of melanotic stool. On [**2563-3-19**],
he was taken for another EGD, at that time which showed the
ulcer was not bleeding. As a result, the patient was felt to
be stable for discharge to home from a GI perspective with
continuation of the b.i.d. Protonix. The patient to follow up
for a repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks as an outpatient.

Cardiac: Cardiac enzymes had been significant for elevated
troponin on admission. Cardiology was contacted who did not
recommend cardiac catheterization or coronary artery bypass
graft. The patient initially received heparin and was
restarted on aspirin, which was approved by GI as long as the
patient had serial hematocrits. The patient was transfused to
keep the hematocrit above 30. He was restarted on atenolol.
The patient was also on Imd[**MD Number 279**] a longer-acting vasodilator
effect. The patient had a couple of episodes of further chest
pain during the admission but had no further EKG changes.

Pulmonary: The patient had some desaturations to 70's and
80's with ambulation without improvement with oxygen with
ambulation, but at this time the patient was completely
asymptomatic and the patient's oxygen saturation recovered
spontaneously to the high 90's on room air with rest. As a
result, this was felt to possibly be not reflective of the
patient's pulmonary status, but reflective of some peripheral
vascular changes with ambulation. The patient was not felt to
need inpatient workup and will follow up with PCP as an
outpatient.

Hematology: The patient with acute blood loss anemia,
received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells, had
serial hematocrits while on heparin gtt and was transfused to
keep the hematocrit above 30.

Musculoskeletal: The patient was restarted on his prednisone
for polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Gastric ulcer.
Gastrointestinal bleed.
Demand ischemia, elevated troponins, and EKG changes in the
setting of acute blood loss anemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Nitroglycerin sublingual.
2. Prednisone 5 mg p.o. daily.
3. Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. p.m., 50 mg p.o. q. a.m.
4. Protonix 40 p.o. b.i.d.
5. Aspirin 325 mg.
6. Isosorbide mononitrate.


DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  Follow up with Cardiology on [**Last Name (LF) 2869**], [**3-25**], at 9:15 a.m. The patient's primary cardiologist is Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 4571**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4571**] was not available so the patient

Pertinent Results:
CT-A [**2966-2-26**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Poorly defined 
opacities within the lungs bilaterally, possibly representing 
combination of atelectasis and consolidation. Air bronchograms 
in the right middle lobe suggests possible infection. 
.
CXR [**2966-2-26**]
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe process suggesting pneumonia.
.
ECHO [**2966-2-26**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is 
moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular 
hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left 
ventricle. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate (2+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is 
eccentric. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may 
be underestimated. There is a small pericardial effusion. 
.
IMPRESSION: Dilated cardiomyopathy with severely depressed LVEF. 
EF 10%.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 35F w/HD who presents with lethary course complicated by 
tachycardia and possible sepsis.
.
1. Hypotension- probably [**2-28**] AVNRT vs. ventricular tachycardia 
in a pt w/baseline EF 10%- cardiology was consulted in the ED 
where it was thought that pt should be managed medically.  She 
received Adenosine x 2 w/o effect and then was cardioverted. 
This was in the setting of infection and deyhdration. Since 
arrival she is +9L. CT-A was negative for a PE; random cortisol 
33.
- trending cardiac enzymes: 0.39, most likely elevated [**2-28**] 
cardioversion
- EP following, plan for medical management of tachycardia 
w/Amiodarone: on drip yesterday for 24 hours, started po 200 q 
daily [**2966-3-1**].
- cardiology and EP satisfied with patients stability, may 
recommend lisinopril low dose as an outpatient, follow up in 1 
month with cardiology
.
2. PNA- Patient received levaquin, vanc, flagyl and ceftriaxone 
in the ED. Imaging concerning for pneumonia.
- trend leukocytosis and fever curve
- change Unasyn for coverage of aspiration PNA to Augmentin 
500mg PO TID today([**4-5**])
- blood cultures: pending
- urine cultures: NGTD final
.
3. Delta MS: Per patient's PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 2503**], and pt's sister- 
patient is at baseline.  Lethargy may have been [**2-28**] infection.  
Will continue infectious w/u and treatment. tox screen negative 
except for benzos.
.
4. Elevated liver enzymes: most likely [**2-28**] shock liver, 
hypotension during v-tach and cardioversion; KUB was normal 
[**2966-3-1**].
- trend LFT's: improving over time
- RUQ ultrasound: liver and gallbladder normal with right 
pleural effusion and ascites; 
.
5. Anemia: stable over hospital course
- Will monitor daily
- Patient has a hx of anemia.

     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.
     
     FINDINGS:  Study is extremely limited by patient motion.  There is no evidence
     of acute intracranial hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
     There is an approximately 11 x 11 mm rounded hyperdensity seen within the left
     insula (series 5, image 11), that does not appear significantly changed from
     previously described lesions dating back to 1994.  This lesion has apparently
     been evaluated by MR, and is most consistent with a cavernous angioma.  There
     is evidence of caudate atrophy with ex vacuo phenomenon seen within the
     anterior frontal horns.  [**Doctor Last Name 23**]-white matter differentiation appears grossly
     preserved.  Visualized paranasal sinuses appear normally aerated.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.  Approximately 1.1
     cm focus of hyperdensity again seen within the left insula, not significantly
     changed from description from [**2953**] and 1995 head MRIs and CTs, previously

Chief Complaint:
chest discomfort and shortness of breath x 2 months
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mediastinoscopy with lymph node biopsy - pathology pending

 
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 37 year old female with PMH endometrial cancer 
s/p TAH w/ R oopherectomy who presented to a [**Hospital 2703**] clinic with 
two month history of shortness of breath and chest pain. She 
describes the chest pain as "like an elephant standing on her 
chest". She notes that it is associated with dyspnea, 
diaphoresis, and lightheadedness. She was referred to a 
cardiologist for a nuclear stress test about 6 weeks ago which 
was normal per pt. Symptoms persisted over last three weeks with 
increased fatigue and weakness. She also notes waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 105**] 
feversv(Tm 100-101), productive cough and 18 pound weight loss 
during this time. At the [**Hospital 2703**] clinic on [**6-29**], a chest x-ray 
was done which was significant for mediastinal widening. She was 
immediately taken by ambulance to Falumouth ED. At [**Hospital1 3254**], a 
Chest CT showed diffuse mediastinal adenopathy and multiple 
pulmonary nodules and splenomegaly. An echo showed small- 
moderate pericardial effusion and increased tuerculation in RV 
apex c/w RVA thrombus. NL EF/valves. Doppler US LE - Left 
popliteal DVT. V/Q scan - indetermingate - 50% chance of PE. 
Patient was stable during one day admission at [**Hospital1 3254**] and was 
transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] FICU for further work up of the pulmonary 
nodules and lymphadenopathy.  While in the FICU, the patient was 
seen by pulmonary and oncology. She was sent for a chest and 
abdominal CT which suggested a 5x4 cm mediastinal mass with 
precarinal lymph[**MD Number 285**], multiple smaller nodules throughout both 
lungs and a small-moderate pericardial effusion. She was 
hemodynamically stable in the FICU and transferred to the floors 
on [**7-1**] pm. 

The patient denies headaches/abdominal pain/melena/hematochezia/ 
change in bowel movements/dysuria.

The patient does note 10 year history of perimenopausal symptoms 
- fatigue, myalgias, hot flashes, low grade temps.

[**2721-7-1**] 
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no axillary 
lymphadenopathy. Small 
axillary lymph[**MD Number 285**] do not meet the criteria for pathologic 
enlargement and 
measure up to 6 mm in size. A large mediastinal mass, which 
measures up to 
5.4 x 4.7 cm in axial dimension, which extends from the right 
paratracheal 
region at the level of the thoracic inlet to the precarinal 
lesion is present 
with central regions of hypodensity suggesting necrotic change. 
In addition, 
there is an enlarged 4.5 x 2.5 cm subcarinal lymph node. 
Bulkiness in the 
right hilum is present as well. Evaluation of the central 
airways demonstrate 
patency to the segmental bronchi bilaterally. Examination of the 
lung windows 
demonstrate a dominant 13 x 11 mm nodule within the right upper 
lobe, with a 
satellite lesion in the subpleural right apex measuring 7 mm in 
size. Most of 
these lesions show some characteristics of spiculation. In 
addition, there is 
a 5 mm nodular region in the subpleural right lower lobe, which 
has well- 
defined forbers. The right lower lobe demonstrates mild 
atelectasis, possibly 
with a smaller degree of consolidation as well. There is a trace 
right-sided 
pleural effusion. The left lung is essentially clear, without 
evidence of 
pleural effusion. There are some peripheral blebs suggestive of 
paraseptal 
emphysema. Note is also made of a hypodense appearance of the 
blood relative 
to myocardium suggestive of anemia. There is a small pericardial 
effusion. 
 
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: Allowing for the noncontrast 
technique, 
the liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, stomach, and small 
bowel appear 
unremarkable. The pancreas is grossly unremarkable as well. 
Adrenal glands 
are not clearly visualized due to the lack of IV contrast, and 
no bulky 
lymphadenopathy is the retroperitoneum or mesentery is noted. 
There is no 
abdominal free fluid present. 
 
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: The large bowel and bladder 
are 
unremarkable. Distal ureters are not well visualized without IV 
contrast. The 
uterus is not seen, and the ovaries appear unremarkable. 
 
Examination of the osseous structures show no suspicious lytic 
or blastic 
lesions. 
 
IMRESSION: 
1. Large mediastinal mass with precarinal and subcarinal lymph[**MD Number 761**]. These 
have hypodense central regions suggestive or necrosis. These 
would be most 
ammenable for transbronchial biopsy. 
2. Multiple lung nodules, two of which are spiculated at the 
right lung apex. 
3. There is a small pericardial effusion. 

[**2721-7-2**]
MRI BRAIN. 
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with history of cervical cancer 
with pulmonary 
nodule and mediastinal mass and patient allergic to IV contrast 
for CT, for 
further evaluation to exclude metastatic disease. 
 
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial, and FLAIR, T2 and 
susceptibility axial 
images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium. T1 axial, 
sagittal and 
coronal images were obtained following the administration of 
gadolinium. 
 
FINDINGS: In the right posterofrontal lobe, there are two small 
areas of 
signal abnormality seen within on the FLAIR images, one 
laterally along the 
anterior aspect of the central sulcus and the second superiorly 
to the 
posterior frontal lobe near the midline. Both of these foci 
demonstrate 
enhancement following the administration of gadolinium. No other 
focal 
abnormalities are identified. Specifically, no evidence of 
periventricular 
signal abnormalities are seen. No other areas of enhancement are 
noted. The 
ventricles and extraaxial spaces are normal in size. No evidence 
for midline 
shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus is seen. 
 
IMPRESSION: Foci of signal abnormalities in the right frontal 
lobe with 
enhancement. The differential diagnosis includes metastatic 
disease and 
demyelinating process, given patient's age. However, given the 
clinical 
history and the location of the lesions, metastatic disease is 
considered more 
likely. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
37 year old female with h/o cervical cancer s/p TAH transferred 
from outside hospital with progressive chest discomfort, SOB, 
and weight loss with Left popliteal DVT, possible PE and chest 
xray/ CT evidence of mediastinal mass and multiple bilateral 
nodules with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. 

1. Pulmonary nodules - On admission a chest xray suggested a 
small focal opacity in right upper lobe and right paratracheal 
opacity. A chest CT the following day suggested a large 
mediastinal mass with precarinal and subcarinal lymph[**MD Number 285**] with 
hypodense central regions suggestive of necrosis. It also showed 
multiple nodules, two spiculated lung nodules at right lung 
apex. These lesions were most consistent with lung cancer versus 
lymphoma so a mediastinoscopy was planned. Other things 
originally on the differential were: TB -PPD negative, 
histoplasmosis -antigen still pending, coccidoiomycoses, 
nocardia, sarcoidosis (scandinavian) - ACE-normal. On [**7-2**] she 
had a MRI-brain, which showed two foci of signal abnormalities 
in the right frontal lobe with enhancement. No edema or mass 
effect was seen secondary to the brain lesions. On [**7-4**], she had 
a mediastinoscopy. The frozen section was positive for non-small 
cell lung cancer; paratracheal lymph[**MD Number 285**] were sent for 
pathology (still pending). 

2. Non-small cell lung cancer - Multiple necrotic lymph[**MD Number 285**] 
radiographically and grossly, MRI of the brain with focal right 
frontal brain mets; and a 1 by 1 inch paraspinal hard, rubbery 
lesion on her Left upper back; presentation consistent with 
metastatic NSCLC. Patient was told her diagnosis with her mother 
and grandfather in the room. She seemed to take the news well, 
appropriately becoming teary eyed. She was then seen by a social 
worker and told the social worker that she was coping well and 
did not need to be seen anymore. She was seen by oncology 
consult and set up for 
an outpatient follow up with multidisciplinary oncology team on 
thursday [**7-7**]. During that time she will discuss chemo vs 
biologic therapies vs palliation.
She will also have a bone scan to evaluate for bone mets also on 
thursday as an o/p. On the last day of admission, the patient 
noted blurriness in left periphery; no deficit on visual fields 
or neuro exam; the patient was advised to have a head ct to 
reevaluate for mass effect or bleeding in the brain lesions, but 
she refused and wanted to go home with no further treatment. She 
was counseled to go to the ED if she had worsening vision 
deficits, headaches. The patient's shortness of breath was 
stable during the admission; she required 2L oxygen especially 
during long conversations; the patient will be sent home on home 
oxygen.

2. Hypercoagulable state - DVT/PE/?RV thrombus - echo at outside 
hospital also with possible thrombus in RV; pt obviously 
hypercoagulable most likely secondary to primary lung 
malignancy; she was maintained on heparin throughout the 
admission and was switched to Lovenox and underwent Lovenox 
administration teaching prior to discharge

3. Pericardial effusion - found on echo at [**Hospital1 **]; stable on 
chest CT at [**Hospital1 19**].Most likely secondary to the primary lung 
malignancy; patient did not experience any decreases in blood 
pressure, increased shortness of breath, or increased chest pain 
during the admission. SHe was monitored throughout the admission 
for tamponade physiology and did not present with any.  

4. Fevers - low grade throughout admission; most likely 
secondary to the malignancy; fungal, blood cultures were 
negative; lyme antibody was negative; patient never mounted an 
increased white blood cell count.  

5. Pain/Nausea - The patient had back and chest (pleural) pain 
throughout the admission well controlled PRN dilaudid q [**2-10**] 
hours. She was started on a fentanyl patch for pain on [**2721-7-4**] 
with dilaudid for breakthrough. SHe also noted increased nausea 
with the dilaudid which was well controlled with phenergan. 
After the mediastinoscopy, she had increased throat pain which 
was relieved with viscous lidocaine.  

6. 10 year hisory of perimenopausal symptoms - FSH, LH within 
normal limits; no further work-up during the admission

7. PPX - She was maintained on a multivitamin and zantac during 
the admission with colace and senna to releive constipation in 
the setting of narcotics.)

occlusion, circumflex 70% occlusion and right coronary artery
totally occluded.  Post cardiac catheterization,
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted.  In summary, the
patient was accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting at a
later date following a complete workup including carotid
dopplers, pulmonary function tests, and echocardiogram to
assess left ventricular function as well as his mitral
regurgitation and resolution of his right middle lobe
infiltrates as well as diuresis prior to his surgery.  The
patient was maintained on the Medical Service prior to his
surgery during his preoperative testing.  On [**1-4**], he
experienced an episode of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia.  At that time he was seen by the
electrophysiology service who recommended that the patient be
loaded with amiodarone and started on heparin.  On [**1-7**] the patient complained of abdominal pain.  Following his
complaint of abdominal pain he had decreasing level of
consciousness followed by a cardiac arrest during which he
had periods of asystole, lasting six to eight seconds.
During that time he was pulseless.  He did rule in for a
non-Q wave myocardial infarction following his cardiac
arrest.  A temporary pacing wire was placed and he was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for continued
monitoring prior to his coronary artery bypass grafting.

The [**Hospital 101**] hospital course was further complicated by an
episode of ventricular tachycardia during which the patient
was pulseless.  This occurred on [**1-10**].  The patient
was shocked out of the ventricular tachycardia with 300
joules followed by ventricular pacing with the temporary wire
he had in place.  The following morning, [**1-11**], the
patient was brought to the Operating Room where he underwent
an off-pump coronary artery bypass graft times one with a
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending,
please see the operation report for full details.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well and he was transferred
from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit.  At the time of transfer, the patient's mean arterial
pressure was 70, central venous pressure was 12, he was
ventricularly paced at a rate of 70.  He had a propofol at 20
mcg/kg/min and Neosynephinre at 0.3 mcg/kg/min.  The patient
did well in the immediately postoperative period.  He
remained on his Neosynephrine infusion to keep his mean
arterial pressure greater than 70.  He remained intubated
throughout postoperative day #1 in anticipation of an
angioplasty to be done on postoperative day #1.

As stated, the patient was brought to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory on postoperative day #1.  At that
time his coronary arteries were again studied.  The
catheterization showed his left anterior descending to have
an 80% occlusion with competitive flow distally, circumflex
and obtuse marginal 1 to be 80% occluded and the right
coronary artery to be 100% occluded with proximal filling via
left to right collaterals.  His left internal mammary artery
to the left anterior descending was widely patent with normal
flow.  At that time he underwent an angioplasty of his obtuse
marginal 1 lesion.  The lesion was crossed and stented with
no residual lesion.  The patient tolerated the procedure
well, please see the catheterization report for full details.
Following the catheterization and stenting the patient was
transferred from the Catheterization Laboratory to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  Upon arrival the
patient's sedation was discontinued.  He was weaned from his
ventilator and ultimately extubated.  For the next 48 hours
the patient remained in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit, monitoring his hemodynamic stability and his
respiratory status.  On postoperative day #4 the patient was
transferred to Far 6 for continuing postoperative care and
cardiac rehabilitation.  Over the next several days the
patient remained on the Cardiothoracic Step Down Floor.  His
activity level was slowly increased with the aid of physical
therapy and the nursing staff.  He continued to be followed
by the Electrophysiology Service and on postoperative day #10
he was brought to the Electrophysiology Suite where he
underwent electrophysiology studies and automatic implanted
cardioverter defibrillator placement.  Please see
electrophysiology study report for full details.  The patient
remained on Cardiothoracic Step Down Floor for two additional
days at which time he was deemed stable and ready for
transfer to rehabilitation.

At the time of transfer to rehabilitation, the patient's
physical examination is as follows:  Vital signs temperature
97.7, heartrate 67, ventricularly paced, blood pressure
145/70, respiratory rate 18 and oxygen saturation 99% on 3
liters.  Weight preoperatively is 125 kg, at discharge is
121.8 kg.  Laboratory data on the day of discharge is white
count 9.5, hematocrit 28.7, platelets 273, PT 14, PTT 28.7,
INR 1.4.  Sodium 141, potassium 4.6, chloride 102, carbon
dioxide 31, BUN 24, creatinine 1.1, glucose 100.  On physical
examination he is alert and oriented times three, moves all
extremities and is conversant.  Respiratory, diffuse rhonchi
bilaterally, no rales.  Heartsounds, regular rate and rhythm.
Sternum is stable.  Incision with steri-strips, open to air,
clean and dry.  Abdomen is soft, nontender with normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm with 2 to 3+ edema and
palpable dorsalis pedis pulses.  The patient does complain of
pain in the right groin including the upper leg.  This pain
was noted preoperatively.  He had bilateral groin ultrasounds
which were negative for pseudoaneurysm.

     CLINICAL DATA: 85 year old male pre-operative for coronary artery bypass
     grafting who presents for evaluation for carotid stenosis examination complete
     carotid series.
     
     Grayscale, color flow, and spectral analysis of the carotid systems was
     performed bilaterally.
     
     FINDINGS: Evaluation of the right carotid system demonstrates mild posterior
     plaque involving the origin of the internal carotid artery. The flow
     velocities are as follows: internal carotid artery 86/17, common carotid
     90/10, external carotid artery 164 with an internal carotid to common carotid
     artery ratio of 0.96. These values correspond to a mild less than 40%
     stenosis.
     
     Evaluation of the left carotid system demonstrates mild plaque along the
     posterior wall of the common carotid artery and external carotid artery and
     anterior wall of the internal carotid artery. The flow velocities are as
     follows: internal carotid 109/19, common carotid artery 71/15, external
     carotid artery 195 with an internal carotid to common carotid artery ratio of
     1.5. These values correspond to a mild less than 40% stenosis.
     
     The vertebral arteries were non-visible bilaterally.
     
     IMPRESSION: Mild less than 40% stenosis of the internal carotid arteries
     bilaterally.

     TECHNIQUE:  Suboptimal film secondary to underexposure and respiratory
     artifact.  Additionally the left costophrenic angle is not included in the
     film.
     
     FINDINGS:  In the interval since the prior study, an endotracheal tube has
     been placed and the tip is well positioned approximately 5 cm above the
     carina.  There is also a new NG tube, the tip of which cannot be assessed
     secondary to underexposure.
     
     There is mild cardiomegaly.  The mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  In the
     interval since the prior study, there is increase in retrocardiac
     opacification and there may be associated pleural effusion, however the left
     cardiophrenic angle is not included in the radiograph provided.  There is no
     right-sided pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The pulmonary
     vasculature is difficult to evaluate secondary to respiratory artifact.  No
     air is seen below the diaphragms, however this is a supine study.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Increase in retrocardiac opacification which may represent
     atelectasis however an underlying infectious process cannot be ruled out.
     2)  Well-positioned endo-tracheal tube.
     3)  NG tube position difficult to evaluate secondary to underexposed film.

     approach performed twice in the recent past.  Now with decreased hematocrit
     and a tender inguinal region.
     
     CT LOWER LIMBS:
     
     Axial images were obtained from the acetabulae to the distal femurs
     bilaterally.  No IV contrast was administered due elevated creatinine.
     
     There are complex fluid collections identified in the medial right thigh both
     of which contain fluid/fluid layers.  The largest of these is within the
     adductor muscle group and a maximum dimension in the axial plane of 4.3 x 9.2
     cm.  Another complex fluid collection is present more inferiorly in the medial
     right thigh and has a maximum axial dimension of 4.3 x 8.3 cm.  These both
     represent hematomas with hematocrit levels.  Although there is no significant
     fat stranding adjacent to these complex fluid collections infection cannot be
     entirely excluded.  The left thigh is within normal limits.  No worrisome
     blastic or lytic bony lesions are identified.

     INDICATION: Sepsis renal failure, rule out abscess.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases to the pubic symphysis with oral contrast only.
     
     CONTRAST: Oral contrast was given without intravenous contrast secondary to
     the patient's renal status.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is respiratory motion limiting the
     evaluation of the lung bases however there are bilateral pleural effusions
     with the left being greater than the right. On the left there is associated
     compressive atelectasis with the pleural effusion. No definite masses or
     opacities are noted. Overall the size of the liver is small this is either a
     congenital variant or related to cirrhosis. There are scattered calcified
     foci representing old granulomatous infection of the liver and the large and
     small bowel are unremarkable. There are prominent vascular calcifications
     throughout the abdomen. A small hiatal hernia is seen. Within the right kidney
     there is a region of low attenuation near the upper pole. Without intravenous
     contrast this cannot be accurately characterized. This may represent an old
     infarct, simple cyst, or a mass. The left kidney is unremarkable. There is no
     free air and no free fluid and no mesenteric or retroperitoneal
     lymphadenopathy present.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid, bladder, and
     prostate are normal. There is no free pelvic fluid and no pelvic or inguinal
     lymphadenopathy. On limited views of the right thigh there is a large hematoma
     in the posterior compartment and adductor canal. There is also some stranding
     surrounding the right femoral region with no clear connection to the
     previously noted hematoma. There is a right hydrocele.
     
     Osseous structures demonstrate degenerative changes in the lower lumbar and
     the thoracic spine.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1. A large hematoma in the right thigh. See the dictation on lower
     extremity CT scan done on the same day. 2. Fat stranding surrounding the right
     femoral region without clear connection to the hematoma. This could be related
     to any recent procedure in this area. 3. Irregularity of upper pole of right
     kidney.  This cannot be accurately characterized by CT without contrast. If
     concern for a mass exists, recommend MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 10949**],  4. Small liver this
     could represent cirrhosis or congenital variant. 5. Bilateral pleural

     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid, bladder, and
     prostate are normal. There is no free pelvic fluid and no pelvic or inguinal
     lymphadenopathy. On limited views of the right thigh there is a large hematoma
     in the posterior compartment and adductor canal. There is also some stranding
     surrounding the right femoral region with no clear connection to the
     previously noted hematoma. There is a right hydrocele.
     
     Osseous structures demonstrate degenerative changes in the lower lumbar and
     the thoracic spine.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1. A large hematoma in the right thigh. See the dictation on lower
     extremity CT scan done on the same day. 2. Fat stranding surrounding the right
     femoral region without clear connection to the hematoma. This could be related
     to any recent procedure in this area. 3. Irregularity of upper pole of right
     kidney.  This cannot be accurately characterized by CT without contrast. If
     concern for a mass exists, recommend MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 10949**],  4. Small liver this
     could represent cirrhosis or congenital variant. 5. Bilateral pleural
     effusions.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      85 year old man with acute bradycardia in 20's, abd pain, hemodynamic
      instability. 3vd waiting CABG.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      s/p pacer wire placement
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     HISTORY:  Assess pacer wire placement.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3094-1-7**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Suboptimal chest radiograph secondary to underexposure and
     clipping of left costophrenic angle.
     
     FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube remains well positioned.  The nasogastric
     tube is now seen extending below the diaphragms into the stomach.  There is a
     new single pacer wire entering via right IJ access.  This pacer wire is seen
     coursing toward the right ventricular apex, however, the tip cannot be seen
     secondary to underexposure of the film.
     
     The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged since the prior study.  Again
     seen is opacification in the left lower lung which is not changed since the
     prior study.  Again left sided pleural efefusion may be present, however the
     left costophrenic angle is not included in this film.  The right lung is
     unchanged in appearance.  There is no pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Single pacer wire entering via right IJ and
     eventually coursing toward right ventricular apex, though the tip cannot be
     seen.  A repeat film is recommended with different technique to better
     identify tip of catheter.
     
     2)  Endotracheal tube and NG tube appear well positioned.
     
     3)  Unchanged appearance of retrocardiac opacification which could represent
     atelectasis or pneumonia.

     CHEST AP PORTABLE.
     
     INDICATION: Patient awaiting bypass surgery, s/p intubation for hypotension
     and bradycardia. Now with new temperature spike, evaluate for infiltrate.
     
     FINDINGS: Portable chest x ray with patient in supine position shows ETT with
     tip some 4 cm above carina. An NG tube is present apparently reaching below
     the diaphragm. No evidence of pneumothorax.
     
     As the patient is rotated, the cardiac shadow superimposes the left lung base
     but remarkably the diaphragm cannot be seen at all a finding which is
     suggestive of left lower lobe atelectasis or perhaps infiltrate.
     
     The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates a diffuse perivascular haze consistent
     with CHF but no local acute infiltrates can be identified. No pneumothorax is
     present. A central venous line is noted advanced via the right sided jugular
     approach its termination point is impossible to assess because of the
     underpenetrated mediastinal structures. It appears to be unchanged when
     comparing it with the previous examination of 12/24.

     INDICATION:  IJ placement.
     
     PORTABLE CHEST:  A supine chest from 5:57 pm is compared to earlier film from
     2:30 am the same day.  A right IJ central venous catheter is again noted.  The
     tip is more difficult to see due to structures outside/overlying the chest,
     but again does appear to be in SVC.  The entire right lateral costophrenic
     angle is not included on the film, to allow satisfactory evaluation for
     pneumothorax in the supine position.
     
     The appearance of the lungs is unchanged.  There is still hazy increased
     density in the left base with poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm with
     some diffuse indistinctness of vessel and hilar outlines.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Right IJ catheter tip difficult to see, but apparently within the
     SVC.  Repeat film without overlying artifact and including the entire right
     lateral costophrenic angle is recommended.

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left vertebral artery origin stenosis. 
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same status post stent angioplasty of the left
     vertebral artery origin.
     
     ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia.
     
     INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7289**] is a 69-year-old man who was found to
     have a left vertebral artery critical stenosis as well as bilateral carotid
     artery disease. He is status post carotid endarterectomy and is now slated to
     undergo treatment of his vertebral origin stenosis.
     
     CONSENT: The patient and his family was given a full and complete explanation
     of the procedure. Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits, and
     alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail. In addition, the
     possible complications, such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death, were outlined. The
     patient and his family understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought into the Endovascular Suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The left groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 19-gauge single-wall needle was then
     used to puncture the left common femoral artery, and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 7 French vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and
     kept on a heparinized saline drip. Next, a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels: left subclavian artery, left
     vertebral artery. After obtaining access and placement of a guidecatheter into
     the left vertebral artery an angiogrphic run was performed. The patient was
     administered heparinization to achieve an activated clotting time of 250
     seconds. He was then pretreated with plavix and aspirin. At this point a
     microwire was used to cross the critical stenosis and subsequently a 2 mm x 9
     mm Maverick over-the-wire balloon was used to perform angioplasty of the
     origin of the left vertebral artery. The balloon was then withdrawn and an AVE
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     S670 4 mm x 9 mm was used to perform angioplasty at the origin of the left
     vertebral artery. The balloon was then removed and angiographic run was
     performed through the left subclavian artery with the wire crossing the left
     vertebral artery. This showed no evidence of dissection and a good
     angiographic result with complete resolution of the stenosis at the left
     vertebral artery origin. Small portion of the stent is seen to extend into the
     left subclavian artery. However this does not represent any consequence in
     terms of flow limitation and is unavoidable in order to perform adequate
     angioplasty of the stenotic segment. At this point the microwire was removed
     from the left vertebral artery and an angiographic run was performed of the
     left subclavian artery which showed excellent improvement in the stenosis in
     the antegrade flow. Angiographic run of the intracranial portion of the left
     vertebral artery showed a patent basilar artery and patent bilateral posterior
     cerebral and bilateral superior cerebellar artery in the right-sided ICA
     vessel with a left-sided ICA-PICA vessel. There is a little bit of retrograde
     reflux into the right vertebral artery which was previously documented to be
     occluded proximally. At this point the guidecatheter was withdrawn from the
     patient and an angiographic run was performed of the iliac artery which
     appears to be heavily calcified and hypotrophied and accordingly a manual
     compression was used later to remove the sheath. Patient did well
     neurologically and was transferred to intensive care unit in stable condition.
     
     IMPRESSION: Critical left vertebral artery origin stenosis treated using
     primary angioplasty followed by stent angioplasty with significant improvement
     in left vertebral artery flow.

     (Cont)
     S670 4 mm x 9 mm was used to perform angioplasty at the origin of the left
     vertebral artery. The balloon was then removed and angiographic run was
     performed through the left subclavian artery with the wire crossing the left
     vertebral artery. This showed no evidence of dissection and a good
     angiographic result with complete resolution of the stenosis at the left
     vertebral artery origin. Small portion of the stent is seen to extend into the
     left subclavian artery. However this does not represent any consequence in
     terms of flow limitation and is unavoidable in order to perform adequate
     angioplasty of the stenotic segment. At this point the microwire was removed
     from the left vertebral artery and an angiographic run was performed of the
     left subclavian artery which showed excellent improvement in the stenosis in
     the antegrade flow. Angiographic run of the intracranial portion of the left
     vertebral artery showed a patent basilar artery and patent bilateral posterior
     cerebral and bilateral superior cerebellar artery in the right-sided ICA
     vessel with a left-sided ICA-PICA vessel. There is a little bit of retrograde
     reflux into the right vertebral artery which was previously documented to be
     occluded proximally. At this point the guidecatheter was withdrawn from the
     patient and an angiographic run was performed of the iliac artery which
     appears to be heavily calcified and hypotrophied and accordingly a manual
     compression was used later to remove the sheath. Patient did well
     neurologically and was transferred to intensive care unit in stable condition.
     
     IMPRESSION: Critical left vertebral artery origin stenosis treated using
     primary angioplasty followed by stent angioplasty with significant improvement
     in left vertebral artery flow.

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left vertebral artery origin stenosis. 
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same status post stent angioplasty of the left
     vertebral artery origin.
     
     ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia.
     
     INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7289**] is a 69-year-old man who was found to
     have a left vertebral artery critical stenosis as well as bilateral carotid
     artery disease. He is status post carotid endarterectomy and is now slated to
     undergo treatment of his vertebral origin stenosis.
     
     CONSENT: The patient and his family was given a full and complete explanation
     of the procedure. Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits, and
     alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail. In addition, the
     possible complications, such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death, were outlined. The
     patient and his family understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought into the Endovascular Suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The left groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 19-gauge single-wall needle was then
     used to puncture the left common femoral artery, and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 7 French vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and
     kept on a heparinized saline drip. Next, a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels: left subclavian artery, left
     vertebral artery. After obtaining access and placement of a guidecatheter into
     the left vertebral artery an angiogrphic run was performed. The patient was
     administered heparinization to achieve an activated clotting time of 250
     seconds. He was then pretreated with plavix and aspirin. At this point a
     microwire was used to cross the critical stenosis and subsequently a 2 mm x 9
     mm Maverick over-the-wire balloon was used to perform angioplasty of the
     origin of the left vertebral artery. The balloon was then withdrawn and an AVE

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left vertebral artery origin stenosis. 
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same status post stent angioplasty of the left
     vertebral artery origin.
     
     ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia.
     
     INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7289**] is a 69-year-old man who was found to
     have a left vertebral artery critical stenosis as well as bilateral carotid
     artery disease. He is status post carotid endarterectomy and is now slated to
     undergo treatment of his vertebral origin stenosis.
     
     CONSENT: The patient and his family was given a full and complete explanation
     of the procedure. Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits, and
     alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail. In addition, the
     possible complications, such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death, were outlined. The
     patient and his family understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought into the Endovascular Suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The left groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 19-gauge single-wall needle was then
     used to puncture the left common femoral artery, and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 7 French vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and
     kept on a heparinized saline drip. Next, a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels: left subclavian artery, left
     vertebral artery. After obtaining access and placement of a guidecatheter into
     the left vertebral artery an angiogrphic run was performed. The patient was
     administered heparinization to achieve an activated clotting time of 250
     seconds. He was then pretreated with plavix and aspirin. At this point a
     microwire was used to cross the critical stenosis and subsequently a 2 mm x 9
     mm Maverick over-the-wire balloon was used to perform angioplasty of the
     origin of the left vertebral artery. The balloon was then withdrawn and an AVE
                                                                 (Over)

     S670 4 mm x 9 mm was used to perform angioplasty at the origin of the left
     vertebral artery. The balloon was then removed and angiographic run was
     performed through the left subclavian artery with the wire crossing the left
     vertebral artery. This showed no evidence of dissection and a good
     angiographic result with complete resolution of the stenosis at the left
     vertebral artery origin. Small portion of the stent is seen to extend into the
     left subclavian artery. However this does not represent any consequence in
     terms of flow limitation and is unavoidable in order to perform adequate
     angioplasty of the stenotic segment. At this point the microwire was removed
     from the left vertebral artery and an angiographic run was performed of the
     left subclavian artery which showed excellent improvement in the stenosis in
     the antegrade flow. Angiographic run of the intracranial portion of the left
     vertebral artery showed a patent basilar artery and patent bilateral posterior
     cerebral and bilateral superior cerebellar artery in the right-sided ICA
     vessel with a left-sided ICA-PICA vessel. There is a little bit of retrograde
     reflux into the right vertebral artery which was previously documented to be
     occluded proximally. At this point the guidecatheter was withdrawn from the
     patient and an angiographic run was performed of the iliac artery which
     appears to be heavily calcified and hypotrophied and accordingly a manual
     compression was used later to remove the sheath. Patient did well
     neurologically and was transferred to intensive care unit in stable condition.
     
     IMPRESSION: Critical left vertebral artery origin stenosis treated using
     primary angioplasty followed by stent angioplasty with significant improvement
     in left vertebral artery flow.

     (Cont)
     S670 4 mm x 9 mm was used to perform angioplasty at the origin of the left
     vertebral artery. The balloon was then removed and angiographic run was
     performed through the left subclavian artery with the wire crossing the left
     vertebral artery. This showed no evidence of dissection and a good
     angiographic result with complete resolution of the stenosis at the left
     vertebral artery origin. Small portion of the stent is seen to extend into the
     left subclavian artery. However this does not represent any consequence in
     terms of flow limitation and is unavoidable in order to perform adequate
     angioplasty of the stenotic segment. At this point the microwire was removed
     from the left vertebral artery and an angiographic run was performed of the
     left subclavian artery which showed excellent improvement in the stenosis in
     the antegrade flow. Angiographic run of the intracranial portion of the left
     vertebral artery showed a patent basilar artery and patent bilateral posterior
     cerebral and bilateral superior cerebellar artery in the right-sided ICA
     vessel with a left-sided ICA-PICA vessel. There is a little bit of retrograde
     reflux into the right vertebral artery which was previously documented to be
     occluded proximally. At this point the guidecatheter was withdrawn from the
     patient and an angiographic run was performed of the iliac artery which
     appears to be heavily calcified and hypotrophied and accordingly a manual
     compression was used later to remove the sheath. Patient did well
     neurologically and was transferred to intensive care unit in stable condition.
     
     IMPRESSION: Critical left vertebral artery origin stenosis treated using
     primary angioplasty followed by stent angioplasty with significant improvement
     in left vertebral artery flow.

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left vertebral artery origin stenosis. 
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same status post stent angioplasty of the left
     vertebral artery origin.
     
     ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia.
     
     INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7289**] is a 69-year-old man who was found to
     have a left vertebral artery critical stenosis as well as bilateral carotid
     artery disease. He is status post carotid endarterectomy and is now slated to
     undergo treatment of his vertebral origin stenosis.
     
     CONSENT: The patient and his family was given a full and complete explanation
     of the procedure. Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits, and
     alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail. In addition, the
     possible complications, such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death, were outlined. The
     patient and his family understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought into the Endovascular Suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The left groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 19-gauge single-wall needle was then
     used to puncture the left common femoral artery, and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 7 French vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and
     kept on a heparinized saline drip. Next, a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels: left subclavian artery, left
     vertebral artery. After obtaining access and placement of a guidecatheter into
     the left vertebral artery an angiogrphic run was performed. The patient was
     administered heparinization to achieve an activated clotting time of 250
     seconds. He was then pretreated with plavix and aspirin. At this point a
     microwire was used to cross the critical stenosis and subsequently a 2 mm x 9
     mm Maverick over-the-wire balloon was used to perform angioplasty of the
     origin of the left vertebral artery. The balloon was then withdrawn and an AVE
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Fever.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     Compared to [**3094-1-13**], the left chest tube has been reoriented and there is
     resolution of previously-seen kink in the tube.  A second tube overlies the
     right lung base but courses from the medial aspect and is in a slightly
     unusual location.  While it has not changed from [**3094-1-13**], verification of
     intended location of the tip of the tube is recommended.
     
     Subtle increase in markings is appreciated over the right lung base but could
     be related to slightly more oblique positioning.  This finding is somewhat
     subtle and clinical correlation along with follow-up x-ray is recommended.  No
     definite new infiltrates were seen.  Cardiac silhouette remains stable.
     Pulmonary vascular markings are stable and normal.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Only interval change is a possible increased prominence of markings at the
     right lung base but this finding is subtle and could be related to rotational
     positioning of patient.
     
     Comparison to auscultory findings and follow-up film recommended.

     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
     Persantine was infused intravenously for approximately 4 minutes at a  dose of 
     approximately 0.142 mg/kg/min.  
      
     HISTORY:  Chest pain, patient is s/p CABG. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:  One to three minutes after the cessation of infusion, 
     MIBI was administered IV.
      
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.
      
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium.
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
      
     Stress images demonstrate a severe perfusion defect along the inferior wall. 
     Resting perfusion images demonstrate that this defect is primarily fixed.   Note
     is made of an enlarge right ventricle. 
      
     Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
     Persantine administration shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of
     approximately 50%.  Note is made of hypokinesis along the inferior wall.
      
     No prior studies are available for comparison.
      
     IMPRESSION:  1) Severe, primarily fixed perfusion defect along the inferior
     wall.  There is associated hypokinesis of the inferior wall.  Enlarged right
     ventricle.  2) Ejection fraction of 50%. /nkg

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  85 year old man status post coronary artery bypass with
     elevated white blood cell count.  Evaluate for mediastinitis or abscess.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung apices through the lung bases following the administration of 100 cc of
     Optiray contrast IV.  Optiray contrast was administered in light of this
     patient's cardiac history.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are small bilateral pleural effusions, right
     greater than left.  To the left of the sternum at the level of the aortic
     arch, there is a tiny pocket of gas with no identifiable associated fluid.
     More inferiorly, just posterior to the xyphoid, there is a 1.4 x 2.9 cm pocket
     of fluid which also contains at least one small pocket of gas.  No large or
     organized abscess collections are identified.  The patient is status post
     median sternotomy.  The heart is unremarkable.  Epicardial pacer leads are
     identified and there are extensive calcifications of the coronary arteries. No

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  85 year old man status post coronary artery bypass with
     elevated white blood cell count.  Evaluate for mediastinitis or abscess.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung apices through the lung bases following the administration of 100 cc of
     Optiray contrast IV.  Optiray contrast was administered in light of this
     patient's cardiac history.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are small bilateral pleural effusions, right
     greater than left.  To the left of the sternum at the level of the aortic
     arch, there is a tiny pocket of gas with no identifiable associated fluid.
     More inferiorly, just posterior to the xyphoid, there is a 1.4 x 2.9 cm pocket
     of fluid which also contains at least one small pocket of gas.  No large or
     organized abscess collections are identified.  The patient is status post
     median sternotomy.  The heart is unremarkable.  Epicardial pacer leads are
     identified and there are extensive calcifications of the coronary arteries. No

     TWO VIEWS CHEST, is compared to one day earlier.
     
     INDICATION:  ICD placement.
     
     The examination is somewhat limited by body habitus.  There has been placement
     of an ICD with one lead terminating in the right atrium and the other
     terminating in the right ventricle.  Although the leads are well demonstrated
     on the frontal view, they are more difficult to visualize on the lateral view
     due to summation of the patient's arm, which was not lifted due to recent ICD
     placement.
     
     There are persistent bilateral pleural effusions.  No  pneumothorax is
     evident.  Minor atelectatic changes are seen in the right mid and both
     lower lung zones.  The bones demonstrate diffuse demineralization  and
     degenerative changes.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) ICD leads appear to terminate right atrium and right ventricle. However,
     the ventricular lead in particular is difficult to accurately visualize on the
     lateral projection due to overlapping soft tissue structures of the patient's
     arm and general obese body habitus.  When the patient's arm can be lifted,
     repeat lateral view to confirm appropriate placement may be helpful.
     2)  Persistent bilateral pleural effusions.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 69-year-old man was
transferred from [**Hospital6 2076**] on the [**5-23**] to
[**Hospital1 10**].  He has a history of
coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
prostate and lung cancer with severe carotid stenosis and
transient ischemic attacks who is referred now with the
abrupt onset of speech difficulty and right-sided weakness.
The patient had been hospitalized briefly in May with speech
difficulty and right-sided weakness.  His studies back in May
showed severe bilateral carotid stenosis and there was
thought to be a critical stenosis on the right, a marked
stenosis on the left.  CT scan was normal and the patient had
been on aspirin and was then started on Plavix.  He was
referred to [**Hospital3 **] and he was scheduled for a carotid
endarterectomy a week prior to his admission.  On the day of
admission aspirin and Plavix had been stopped in anticipation
of this upcoming surgery, however, while at home patient fell
asleep, complained to his wife of not feeling well and found
him a few hours later slumped over in the bed and felt that
his speech was slurred and not very comprehensible.  He
complained of double vision at the time.  Paramedics reported
that he was moving his extremities, however, developed
right-sided weakness when he arrived at [**Hospital6 2076**].

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Lipitor, Cardia,
hydrochlorothiazide, bronchodilators.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery bypass graft in [**3289**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He had been a smoker for the majority of his
life though only smoking a few cigarettes a day.  He quit in
[**3297-6-13**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was awake and fairly alert with
fluent speech.  No dysarthria.  He repeats well and there is
no anomia.  He follows commands.  Cranial nerves:  Pupils
were small and reactive to light.  Fundi were not seen.  He
had a fairly pronounced vertical gaze palsy.  There was
suggestion of slight lateral rectus weakness.  Visual fields
were full to confrontation testing.  There was mild right
central facial weakness.  The other cranial nerves were
intact.  Motor examination showed no drift and normal
strength to confrontation.  Fine finger movements were intact
but finger-to-nose testing was ataxic, especially on the
right.  The patient's findings were remarkable for a vertical
gaze palsy, maybe a right VI nerve palsy which relates to his
complaint of double vision.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 391**] where he was admitted to the hospital, was started on
anticoagulation and carotid duplex was performed.  He was
admitted to the Vascular Service there and a stroke consult
was done.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White count 13.7, hematocrit 34.6,
platelet count 209,000, PT 12.8, PTT 36.4, INR 1.1.  Sodium
137, potassium 4.0, BUN 24, creatinine 1.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The stroke team recommended stopping
heparin on his admission day and just continuing on aspirin
and Plavix with their considering recent strokes.  The MRI
showed acute stroke in the paramedian thalamus and left of
the midbrain.  He also had small areas of stroke in the
cerebellum.  They recommended a four vessel angiogram and a
carotid endarterectomy on the right carotid and once again
the patient was now on the 11th started on heparin.  The
patient was monitored on the floor where he did continue with
double vision and he was prepped for the carotid artery
endarterectomy.  His repeat carotid ultrasound was completed
which shows a narrowing of 80-99% bilaterally of the tardive
RPPCA suggest proximal disease.  On the 12th the patient
continued with double vision.  His blood pressure was in the
140's to 180's and no other distress.  The patient was made
known to the Neurosurgery Service where he was to have an
angiogram done.  On the [**6-24**] he had an angiogram
which showed greater than 85% left vertebral artery stenosis,
an occluded right vertebral artery.  He had greater than 85%
of the right common carotid bifurcation stenosis, 75%
innominate origin stenosis.  It was noted that patient had a
left groin hematoma after the angiogram where he was
monitored closely post-angiogram.  He was also on telemetry
during this time.  He did end up having an ultrasound of the
groin to rule out pseudo-aneurysm.  The Stroke Team, the
Neurology Team and the Vascular Team decided that the patient
should have a right carotid endarterectomy and then have a
stenting of his left vertebral artery.  On the 13th he did
have the ultrasound of his left groin which showed no
pseudo-aneurysm.  The patient was kept on heparin during this
time.  On the [**6-29**] the patient had a right carotid
endarterectomy done.  He tolerated the procedure well.  On
postoperative day one he was awake, alert and oriented.
Incision was clean, dry and intact.  He was reevaluated by
the Stroke Service the same day.  His blood pressure was
140/46, heart rate 74, respirations 14, temperature 97.8.  At
that point he was transferred back to Neurology Service.  The
patient did receive one unit of red blood cells on the 18th.
It was noted on the 19th that he had slight swelling of the
surgical scar, otherwise the patient was okay.  On the 19th
it was noted that that scar had serous fluid.  No pus or
edema.  The site was monitored by the Vascular Service.  The
patient's pain was under control with Percocet.  A follow-up
ultrasound on the 20th showed a patent right carotid, small
right neck hematoma, no evidence of pseudo-aneurysm.  His
left groin hematoma was small, however, improving.  The
patient remained awake, alert and oriented.  His neurological
status was unchanged.  During the postoperative period the
patient was on aspirin and Plavix.  His staples were removed
from the surgical neck site on the 21st.  The site was dry
and intact.  He continued to be followed by Neurology and
Neurosurgery.  Labs on the 23rd showed white count of 7.5,
hematocrit of 39.2, 297,000 for platelets.  On the 25th
patient did have a left vertebroangioplasty and stent.
Estimated blood loss was minimal.  The patient did well with
the procedure.  He woke up awake, alert and oriented.  He had
no drift.  Grasp was [**6-17**] bilaterally.  Lower extremities were
full.  He remained on heparin post stenting at 800 units an
hour and continued on aspirin and Plavix.  The patient was
monitored in the Trauma Intensive Care Unit postoperatively.
He was kept on a Nipride drip to keep his blood pressure less
than 140.  A Rheumatology consult was asked for on the 26th
because of right-sided knee swelling.  There was no erythema,
however, there was increase in warmth.  Patient was thought
to have heterotopic ossification.  It was thought not to be
an infectious process.  Patient was already on aspirin.  They
recommended topical aspirin cream.  The patient was monitored
in the Intensive Care Unit.  On the 27th he continued to need
Nipride to keep his blood pressure less than 140.  He
remained neurologically intact.  Case Management was
following him at this time.  He was moved out of the Unit on
the 28th.  His groin incision was noted to be intact with no
infectious process noted.  No further hematoma.  He remained
neurologically intact.  His blood pressure was well
controlled on oral antihypertensives.  Physical Therapy and
Occupational Therapy were involved in the patient's care and
they recommended home physical therapy and also for Nursing
to follow up with the patient to check blood pressure.
Rheumatology's final recommendations were prednisone taper,
NSAIDS and some local therapy to his right knee.  Patient was
treated for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
urinary tract infection diagnosed on the [**7-9**].  He
was started on intravenous vancomycin.  Infectious Disease
recommended that he start on dicloxacillin for one week after
discharge.

     pneumonia.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior examination of [**3297-6-21**].
     
     FINDINGS: The patient is s/p median sternotomy and right thoracotomy.
     Elevation of the right hila and right sided volume loss is related to the
     patient's known history of cancer resection, presumably within the right upper
     lobe. There is hyperinflation of the lungs with flattening of the diaphragms
     consistent with underlying emphysema. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. The
     heart is normal in size. No focal opacities are seen to suggest aspiration
     and/or pneumonia. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of aspiration and/or pneumonia.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      69 year old man with H/O tia, CAROTID STENOSIS, RECENT cva.  BILATERTAL CAROTID

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: Known carotid disease, recent CVA.
     
     FINDINGS: There is heterogeneous predominantly hyperechoic plaque involving
     the carotid bulbs and extending into the ICA and ECA bilaterally. Peak
     systolic velocities on the right are 353, 72 and 165 cm per second for the
     ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 6.7. On the left, the
     peak systolic velocities are 415, 122 and 68 cm per second for the ICA, CCA
     and ECA respectively. ICA to CCA ratio is 3.4. Findings indicate an 80-99% ICA
     stenosis bilaterally which has progressed compared to the prior exam of 5/03
     (previously graded as 70-79% bilaterally). There is non-visualization of the
     right vertebral artery, normal antegrade flow in the left vertebral artery.
     
     Please note that the Doppler wave form involving the right common carotid
     artery shows a "tardis-[**Last Name (un) 7287**]" shape. This is strongly suggestive of a more
     central stenosis. Prior to consideration for repair of the right ICA,  imaging
     of the more central right system should be performed.
     
     IMPRESSION: Compared with study of 5/03: 1) Progression, now with 80-99%
     bilateral ICA stenoses.
     
     2) Findings as stated above strongly suggestive of a right common carotid
     artery narrowing centrally, out of the range of visualization
     by ultrasound. Would strongly consider an MRA.

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral carotid artery stenosis in the neck now
     status post posterior circulation cerebrovascular accident.  Rule out
     vertebral artery stenosis.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Occluded right vertebral artery at the origin with
     distal reconstitution, critical stenosis of the left vertebral artery origin
     with a hemodynamic significant stenosis, bilateral severe carotid arterial
     origin stenosis in the neck with a greater than 50% stenosis of the innominate
     artery off the aortic arch.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Conscious sedation.
     
     INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7289**] is a 69 year old man with a known
     history of bilateral carotid cervical disease.  He presented with posterior
     circulation cerebrovascular evident.  This prompted work up which suggested
     vertebral artery stenosis.  This angiogram is being performed to better
     delineate the anatomy of his carotid stenosis in order to optimize therapeutic
     plan.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient and his family were given a full and complete
     explanation of the procedure.  Specifically the indications, risks, benefits
     and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
     possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
     patient and his family understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge single wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood a 4 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept
     on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right subclavian artery, left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery
     and aortic arch injection.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the left subclavian artery reveals a greater than 80%

     at the origin of the right vertebral artery with distal reconstitution of the
     mid cervical vertebral artery from paracervical and costocervical trunk
     muscular collaterals.  In addition, there is also reconstruction of the distal

     carotid artery reveals the presence of a critical greater than 85% stenosis at
     the origin of the right internal carotid artery.  In the intracranial portion,
     the right internal carotid artery appears to be free of atherosclerosis
     intracranially and is filling predominantly the right middle cerebral artery.
     Injection of the left common carotid artery reveals the presence of a 65 to
     70% stenosis at the origin of the left internal carotid artery characterized,
     however, by an ulcerated plaque which is has embologenic potential.  The left
     internal carotid artery intracranially perfuses both anterior cerebral
     arteries via a patent anterior communicating artery.  An arch aortogram was
     performed which revealed the presence of a 70% stenosis of the innominate
     artery off the aortic arch, and also reveals no evidence of stenosis at the
     origin of the left common carotid artery or left subclavian artery.  There is
     no evident stenosis at the origin of the right common carotid artery of
     innominate and 10% stenosis of the right subclavian artery origin which is of
     not consequent.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Severe vertebral and carotid disease as described above.

     vertebral artery stenosis.  This angiogram is being performed to better
     delineate the anatomy of his carotid stenosis in order to optimize therapeutic
     plan.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient and his family were given a full and complete
     explanation of the procedure.  Specifically the indications, risks, benefits
     and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
     possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
     patient and his family understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge single wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood a 4 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept
     on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right subclavian artery, left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery
     and aortic arch injection.

     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Occluded right vertebral artery at the origin with
     distal reconstitution, critical stenosis of the left vertebral artery origin
     with a hemodynamic significant stenosis, bilateral severe carotid arterial
     origin stenosis in the neck with a greater than 50% stenosis of the innominate
     artery off the aortic arch.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Conscious sedation.
     
     INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7289**] is a 69 year old man with a known
     history of bilateral carotid cervical disease.  He presented with posterior
     circulation cerebrovascular evident.  This prompted work up which suggested
     vertebral artery stenosis.  This angiogram is being performed to better
     delineate the anatomy of his carotid stenosis in order to optimize therapeutic
     plan.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient and his family were given a full and complete
     explanation of the procedure.  Specifically the indications, risks, benefits
     and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
     possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
     patient and his family understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge single wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood a 4 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept
     on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right subclavian artery, left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery
     and aortic arch injection.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the left subclavian artery reveals a greater than 80%

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left vertebral artery origin stenosis. 
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same status post stent angioplasty of the left
     vertebral artery origin.
     
     ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia.
     
     INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7289**] is a 69-year-old man who was found to
     have a left vertebral artery critical stenosis as well as bilateral carotid
     artery disease. He is status post carotid endarterectomy and is now slated to
     undergo treatment of his vertebral origin stenosis.
     
     CONSENT: The patient and his family was given a full and complete explanation
     of the procedure. Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits, and
     alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail. In addition, the
     possible complications, such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death, were outlined. The
     patient and his family understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought into the Endovascular Suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The left groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 19-gauge single-wall needle was then
     used to puncture the left common femoral artery, and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 7 French vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and
     kept on a heparinized saline drip. Next, a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels: left subclavian artery, left
     vertebral artery. After obtaining access and placement of a guidecatheter into
     the left vertebral artery an angiogrphic run was performed. The patient was
     administered heparinization to achieve an activated clotting time of 250
     seconds. He was then pretreated with plavix and aspirin. At this point a
     microwire was used to cross the critical stenosis and subsequently a 2 mm x 9
     mm Maverick over-the-wire balloon was used to perform angioplasty of the
     origin of the left vertebral artery. The balloon was then withdrawn and an AVE
                                                                 (Over)

     S670 4 mm x 9 mm was used to perform angioplasty at the origin of the left
     vertebral artery. The balloon was then removed and angiographic run was
     performed through the left subclavian artery with the wire crossing the left
     vertebral artery. This showed no evidence of dissection and a good
     angiographic result with complete resolution of the stenosis at the left
     vertebral artery origin. Small portion of the stent is seen to extend into the
     left subclavian artery. However this does not represent any consequence in
     terms of flow limitation and is unavoidable in order to perform adequate
     angioplasty of the stenotic segment. At this point the microwire was removed
     from the left vertebral artery and an angiographic run was performed of the
     left subclavian artery which showed excellent improvement in the stenosis in
     the antegrade flow. Angiographic run of the intracranial portion of the left
     vertebral artery showed a patent basilar artery and patent bilateral posterior
     cerebral and bilateral superior cerebellar artery in the right-sided ICA
     vessel with a left-sided ICA-PICA vessel. There is a little bit of retrograde
     reflux into the right vertebral artery which was previously documented to be
     occluded proximally. At this point the guidecatheter was withdrawn from the
     patient and an angiographic run was performed of the iliac artery which
     appears to be heavily calcified and hypotrophied and accordingly a manual
     compression was used later to remove the sheath. Patient did well
     neurologically and was transferred to intensive care unit in stable condition.
     
     IMPRESSION: Critical left vertebral artery origin stenosis treated using
     primary angioplasty followed by stent angioplasty with significant improvement
     in left vertebral artery flow.

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left vertebral artery origin stenosis. 
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same status post stent angioplasty of the left
     vertebral artery origin.
     
     ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia.
     
     INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7289**] is a 69-year-old man who was found to
     have a left vertebral artery critical stenosis as well as bilateral carotid
     artery disease. He is status post carotid endarterectomy and is now slated to
     undergo treatment of his vertebral origin stenosis.
     
     CONSENT: The patient and his family was given a full and complete explanation
     of the procedure. Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits, and
     alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail. In addition, the
     possible complications, such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death, were outlined. The
     patient and his family understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought into the Endovascular Suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The left groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 19-gauge single-wall needle was then
     used to puncture the left common femoral artery, and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 7 French vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and
     kept on a heparinized saline drip. Next, a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels: left subclavian artery, left
     vertebral artery. After obtaining access and placement of a guidecatheter into
     the left vertebral artery an angiogrphic run was performed. The patient was
     administered heparinization to achieve an activated clotting time of 250
     seconds. He was then pretreated with plavix and aspirin. At this point a
     microwire was used to cross the critical stenosis and subsequently a 2 mm x 9
     mm Maverick over-the-wire balloon was used to perform angioplasty of the
     origin of the left vertebral artery. The balloon was then withdrawn and an AVE
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     S670 4 mm x 9 mm was used to perform angioplasty at the origin of the left
     vertebral artery. The balloon was then removed and angiographic run was
     performed through the left subclavian artery with the wire crossing the left
     vertebral artery. This showed no evidence of dissection and a good
     angiographic result with complete resolution of the stenosis at the left
     vertebral artery origin. Small portion of the stent is seen to extend into the
     left subclavian artery. However this does not represent any consequence in
     terms of flow limitation and is unavoidable in order to perform adequate
     angioplasty of the stenotic segment. At this point the microwire was removed
     from the left vertebral artery and an angiographic run was performed of the
     left subclavian artery which showed excellent improvement in the stenosis in
     the antegrade flow. Angiographic run of the intracranial portion of the left
     vertebral artery showed a patent basilar artery and patent bilateral posterior
     cerebral and bilateral superior cerebellar artery in the right-sided ICA
     vessel with a left-sided ICA-PICA vessel. There is a little bit of retrograde
     reflux into the right vertebral artery which was previously documented to be
     occluded proximally. At this point the guidecatheter was withdrawn from the
     patient and an angiographic run was performed of the iliac artery which
     appears to be heavily calcified and hypotrophied and accordingly a manual
     compression was used later to remove the sheath. Patient did well
     neurologically and was transferred to intensive care unit in stable condition.
     
     IMPRESSION: Critical left vertebral artery origin stenosis treated using
     primary angioplasty followed by stent angioplasty with significant improvement
     in left vertebral artery flow.

     CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE:
     
     REASON:  Patient s/p right carotid endarterectomy.  Evaluate left side with
     known stenosis.
     
     FINDINGS:  Duplex evaluation was performed in both carotid arteries.
     Significant plaque was identified on the left.
     
     On the right peak systolic velocities are 72, 79, 153 in the ICA, CCA, ECA
     respectively.  The ICA to CCA ratio is 0.9.  This is consistent with no
     stenosis.
     
     On the left the peak systolic over diastolic velocity in the internal carotid
     artery is 306/77.  In the remainder of the vessel the peak systolic velocities
     are 114, 152 in the CCA, ECA respectively.  The ICA to CCA ratio is 2.68. This
     is consistent with a 70 to 79% stenosis.
     
     There is antegrade flow in the left vertebral artery only.  The right
     vertebral artery is not visualized.
     
     IMPRESSION:  There is no evidence of stenosis in the right carotid artery s/p
     endarterectomy.  This is compared to the prior study.  On the left there
     continues to be 70 to 79% carotid stenosis.

CV:  Pt had cardiac cath today, films reviewed by Drs [**Last Name (STitle) 486**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 487**].  They feel it's an intramural thrombu and not a pseudoanyeurysm and surgery is not required - follow medically.  Pt has significant steonis in R brachial ceph artery attributing to the difference in the blood pressures in each arm.  Based on central pressures during the procedure, a-line is reading 40mm lower than actual pressures.  Nipride started to maintain SBP <120s, then surgical team rounded and want a-line SBP in 100s.  Nipride currently at .7mcg/kgmin w/ SBP 100/63.  Cath was done via L radial site and pressure clamp in place - to be removed at 1830.  Good perfusion to L hand, 02sat monitor probe on L hand w/ good pleth.  Pedal pulses + by doppler, extrems warm, no edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 11232**] was initially admitted to the BMT 
unit but was transferred to the FICU with progressive hypoxia on 
the floor on [**10-15**].  Her O2 sats dropped to 90% on a NRB.  This 
was originally felt to be due to a combination of causes: 1) CHF 
due to large amt of fluid received via blood products (had 2 
units PRBCs, 3 units platelets in prior 3 days), and 2)? 
aspiration during her bone marrow biopsy [**10-13**].  She had not been 
responding to Lasix on the floor.  Upon admission to the FICU, 
she improved markedly on BiPAP.  Because she was increasingly 
uncomfortable with the BiPAP mask, she was changed back to a NRB 
for awhile, and was eventually placed on nasal CPAP.  Overnight 
on [**10-15**], she began having increasing hemoptysis, first having 
blood-tinged sputum and then coughing up frank blood.  She also 
developed worsening diffuse bilateral infiltrates on CXR.  She 
was intubated on [**10-16**] so that she could undergo bronchoscopy.  
While it was hoped that her intubation was only for the bronch, 
she instead required mechanical ventilatory support until 
[**3412-10-28**].  The bronch revealed increasingly bloody fluid with 
successive lavage, so it was felt she may have DAH (vs a fungal 
or bacterial pna).  She underwent a course of high-dose steroids 
(methylprednisolone 500 mg IV bid x 6 doses) for presumed DAH.  
On [**10-17**], she developed a pneumothorax on the R side that was 
moderate sized (R IJ TLC was placed on evening of 9/23 with 2 
subsequent CXRs not demonstrating a ptx, had bronch [**10-16**], then 
had ptx on CXR [**10-17**], so unclear etiology.)  This was treated 
with 100% O2 and resolved on its own, not requiring chest tube 
placement.  She had another episode of bleeding and underwent 
repeat bronchoscopy [**3412-10-21**].  This was also nondiagnostic.  She 
was very difficult to wean from the ventilator, and eventually a 
family meeting was had with her primary oncologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1280**] 
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  It was decided to extubate her and see how she did, and 
her family preferred not to have her reintubated if she didn't 
do well.  However, she did very well.  She was able to be 
transferred back up to the floor on [**10-30**], and was slowly weaned 
off her oxygen.  By discharge, she was alternating between room 
air and 2 liters O2 per nasal cannula.  She has persistent 
patchy alveolar and interstitial infiltrates on CXR, esp in her 
LLL.  The etiology of her respiratory failure was never fully 
confirmed.  Her [**10-16**] bronch grew out a spore called 
sporobolomyces salmonicolor, which both the ID fellow and the 
Microbiology lab felt was a contaminant (as it didn't grow out 
until [**10-30**]).  She may have had a pneumonia, as she improved on 
caspofungin, ceftazidime, and vancomycin.  She also may have had 
DAH.  She definitely had at least a superimposed component of 
diastolic failure, and she was diuresed aggressively while on 
the floor, approximately 1-2 liters per day.  She was originally 
on standing Lasix, but by time of discharge she only received 
Lasix (20 mg IV) after RBC transfusions.  In terms of the 
etiology of her disease, there was also a question of vasculitis 
(as she has a hx of polyarteritis nodosum which was reportedly 
treated at [**Hospital1 2124**].)  However, her ESR was 18, and house officers 
here obtained her records from [**Hospital1 2124**] which consisted only of one 
CBC and no notes of any sort.

2. Cardiovascular:  On admission, she had an echo that showed an 
EF >55%, with 1+ MR.  On the evening of 9/23, Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 11232**] went 
into a-fib with RVR, rates up to 170s and bp 70s/40s.  She was 
given Lopressor 5 mg IV x1, Diltiazem 10 mg IV x1, and placed on 
a dilt gtt.  She initially did not respond to any of these 
measures, and the dilt gtt was maxed out at 20 mg/hr.  A few 
hours later, she spontaneously converted back to sinus rhythm 
with rates in the 80s, and the dilt gtt was discontinued.  Later 
on in the ICU, she developed what was originally felt to be 
atrial flutter and was evaluated by Cardiology.  They felt she 
had a combination of atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation 
,and recommended control with a dilt gtt as needed, and po 
verapamil.  She eventually no longer required the dilt, and was 
maintained on verapamil with good results.  She remained in NSR 
while on BMT as she was originally monitored on telemetry, which 
was eventually discontinued.  EKGs were unremarkable other than 
a-fib.

3. ID:  Given her fxnal neutropenia, she was begun on empiric 
antibiotics when she originally developed diffuse opacities on 
CXR.  She was treated with Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, bactrim, and 
clinda (initially).  Her vanc was discontinued 2 days later and 
she was begun on ambisome for empiric antifungal coverage.  Due 
to the lipid content in ambisome and its possible interaction 
with surfactant in the lung, she was changed to caspofungin.  
Her induced sputum was immunofluroescent negative for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] 
rest of her bronch studies were negative for organisms other 
than the spore mentioned above.  Her antibiotics were all 
eventually stopped and she remained afebrile for a while.  She 
also developed a sacral decubitus ulcer while in the ICU, which 
was evaluated by the Wound Care nurses and dressed per their 
recommendations.  Twice in the week before discharge, she had 
low-grade temperatures but was asymptomatic.  She had a negative 
urine culture and CXR showed a possible worsening of her LLL 
infiltrate.  The team recommended that she begin po levaquin, 
but she declined this.  She expressly stated that she did not 
want to take any antibiotics, oral or intravenous.  She 
understood the consequences and stated them clearly, but wished 
to not pursue the infectious workup any further.  Therefore she 
was not begun on any antibiotics.

4. Hematology:  Her bone marrow biopsy on [**10-13**] was negative for 
blasts, as was a repeat biopsy [**10-31**].  While she was in the 
hospital, she required increasing frequency of transfusions.  
She received packed red blood cells and platelets every other 
day, to keep a hematocrit greater than 25 and platelets greater 
than 20K (given the fear that she had bled into her lungs, it 
was felt that a platelet transfusion threshold of 20K was more 
advantageous than 10K).  It was felt that her low hematocrit was 
[**2-24**] to her MDS and was not the result of another process.  She 
had a negative DAT x 2.  She did have evidence of hemolysis, 
with a low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, elevated indirect 
bilirubin, and a reticulocyte count of 6%.  Because of her large 
transfusion requirements and possible hemolysis, a super-Coombs 
and an anti-platelet antibody test were sent, and were pending 
at time of discharge.  It was also felt likely that these 
processes were all due to her myelodysplasia.  On examination of 
her bone marrow biopsy, the attending heme pathologist felt that 
it was likely her cells were so dysplastic they did not survive 
long in the periphery.   Prior to d/c a conversation was had 
with the patient where it was discussed and agreed upon by 
everybody (including the attending Hematologist) that there was 
no further treatment indicated for her MDS, and she would 
continue with symptomatic transfusions.    On d/c her WBC count 
was also low, with an ANC of 1100.  This is also felt to be [**2-24**] 
MDS.

5. Liver:  There was a question of whether the patient had 
hemochromatosis, whether iatrogenic or otherwise.  (Has son and 
brother with this disease.)   The hemochromatosis genetic 
mutations were sent and were pending at time of discharge.  Her 
ferritin was greater than 2000.  It was decided not to chelate 
her at this time.

     CLINICAL HISTORY: 78 year old female with myelodysplastic syndrome, now with
     hypotension and left flank pain and bruising.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung bases through
     the symphysis pubis prior to and following the administration of 150 cc of
     Optiray. Nonionic contrast was used due to patient allergy history.
     
     COMPARISON: None available.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The visualized lung bases
     demonstrate small left pleural effusion with associated atelectatic changes.
     Patient has undergone cholecystectomy. The liver, pancreas, and adrenal glands
     appear grossly normal. There is splenomegaly, with an approximate splenic size
     of 16.8 cm. The spleen is diffusely heterogeneous, with evidence of more focal
     lesions. However, evaluation is limited do to the early timing of the contrast
     bolus. There is a 5.6 x 5.7 cm bilobed right renal cyst. Both kidneys are
     otherwise unremarkable. Stomach and proximal loops of small and large bowel
     are unremarkable. There are a few prominent but nonpathologically enlarged
     left paraaortic and mesenteric lymph nodes. The aorta and its major branches
     are widely patent. There is no free fluid or air within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder is
     distended but is otherwise unremarkable. Patient appears to have undergone
     hysterectomy. Pelvic loops of bowel are grossly within normal limits. There is
     no free fluid.
     
     BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes of the mid thoracic spine are noted. No
     suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  62 year-old woman with end stage renal disease and right IJ
     tunnedled dialysis catheter.  CT scan showed thrombus around the catheter in
     the SVC.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1130**], and [**Name5 (PTitle) 89**],
     who was present and supervising.  Informed consent was obtained.  The
     patient's right upper arm was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.
     After infusion of 1% Lidocaine, the right brachial vein accessed under
     ultrasonographic guidance with a 21-gauge needle.  Hardcopy ultrasound images
     were obtained before and after access.  An 018 wire was advanced into the
     brachiocephalic vein and the puncture needle was exchanged for a 4-French
     catheter.  Venogram was performed which demonstrated occlusion of the superior
     vena cava with extensive filling of collaterals.  The 4-French catheter was
     then exchanged over a wire for a 5-French sheath, which was attached to
     continuous flush.  Using a glidewire and C2-Cobra catheter, successful access
     was obtained across the SVC occlusion.  The Cobra catheter was then exchanged
     for a 10 cm TPA infusion catheter.  The catheter was positioned across the
     area of SVC occlusion.  Contrast was injected demonstrating filling defects
     within the SVC consistent with thrombus.  5 mm of TPA were then bolused
     through the infusion catheter.  Following the bolus, a 0.5 mg per hour
     infusion of TPA was started.  200 units per hour of Heparin were infused
     through the sheath.  The sheath and catheter were then secured with suture,
     steri-strips, and tegaderms.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and
     there are no immediate postprocedure complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1. Complete occlusion of the SVC with thrombus.
     
     2.  Placement of TPA infusion catheter across the SVC occlusion.  5 mg bolus
     of TPA administered and 0.5 mg per hour infusion commenced.
     
     3.  The patient should retrun interventional radiology the following morning
     for follow-up venogram.

     PA AND LATERAL CHEST:  The heart shows slight LV enlargement and there is
     evidence of some upper zone redistribution and blurring of vascular detail at
     the bases suggestive of mild LV decompinsation. In addition, there is evidence
     of atelectasis/infiltrate in the posterior basal segment of the left lower
     lobe behind the heart.  This could be due to aspiration versus pneumonia.
     Followup examination is recommended to evaluate this further.

     INDICATION:  78 y/o woman with MDS, fever, left lower lobe effusion, shortness
     of breath.
     
     TECHNIQUE:   Contiguous 5 mm axial CT images of the chest are obtained with
     the administration of IV contrast [**Doctor Last Name 116**], 100 cc Optiray.  The Optiray was used
     due to patient debility.
     
     There is no previous CT study for comparison.
     
     There are multiple low density nodular lesions in the bilateral thyroid gland,
     largest one measuring 13 x 17 mm in diameter.  Further evaluation by
     ultrasound is recommended.
     
     There are multiple mediastinal perivascular lymph nodes, increased both in
     number and size, largest one measuring 11 mm in pretrachea.  In the left lower
     lobe, there is a small pleural effusion with atelectasis.
     
     Coronary artery is calcified.
     
     In the lung window, bilateral multifocal ground glass opacities in somewhat

     INDICATION:  78 y/o woman with MDF, now with fever, productive cough,
     bilateral crackles.
     
     PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
     
     The comparison is made with the previous chest radiograph dated [**3412-10-13**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There are increased multiple ill-defined patchy opacities in
     bilateral lungs, involving both upper and lower lobe areas, which has rapidly
     increased compared to the previous study dated [**3412-10-13**].  There is a dense area
     of possible consolidation in the right lower lobe.  Considering this rapid
     increase in opacity, this most likely represents aspiration pneumonia and
     edema. Altenatively, in this patient with immunocompromised status, multifocal
     infection is a possibility.
     
     The heart is normal in size.  Aortic wall is calcified.
     
     There is an increased opacity in the left lower lobe.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Rapidely increased multifocal ill-defined parenchymal opacities in bilateral
     lungs, with consolidation in right and left lower lobes.  Taking this rapid
     development into consideration, this most likely represents aspiration
     vs. aspiration pneumonia and/or edema.  Alternatively, in this
     immunocompromised patient, multifocal infection is a consideration.

     of breath.
     
     TECHNIQUE:   Contiguous 5 mm axial CT images of the chest are obtained with
     the administration of IV contrast [**Doctor Last Name 116**], 100 cc Optiray.  The Optiray was used
     due to patient debility.
     
     There is no previous CT study for comparison.
     
     There are multiple low density nodular lesions in the bilateral thyroid gland,
     largest one measuring 13 x 17 mm in diameter.  Further evaluation by
     ultrasound is recommended.
     
     There are multiple mediastinal perivascular lymph nodes, increased both in
     number and size, largest one measuring 11 mm in pretrachea.  In the left lower
     lobe, there is a small pleural effusion with atelectasis.
     
     Coronary artery is calcified.
     
     In the lung window, bilateral multifocal ground glass opacities in somewhat
     central distribution are noted, most likely represent pulmonary edema.  Some
     of these opacities can represent aspiration vs. aspiration pneumonia.
     
     Bilateral airways are patent, and there is no endobroncheal lesion.  The

     INDICATION: 78 y/o woman with MDS, pneumonia.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Portable AP chest radiograph.
     
     Comparison is made with the previous chest radiograph dated [**3412-10-18**].
     
     FINDINGS: The location of the right IJ line and ETT are unchanged compared
     with the previous study.
     
     The heart is normal in size.
     
     The previously noted multiple patchy parenchymal opacities has become more
     diffuse and faint in bilateral lungs, with continued faint multiple
     parenchymal opacities. The opacities in bilateral lower lobes has become more
     faint. Again note is made of left lower lobe opacity, which is slightly
     decreased compared with the previous study.
     
     The thoracic aorta is tortuous.
     
     No pneumothorax is noted.
     
     IMPRESSION: Gradually improving multiple patchy opacities in both lungs, with
     residual diffuse faint opacities, most likely representing pulmonary edema vs.
     aspiration. Improved left lower lobe opacities. No pneumothorax.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Check ETT placement and CHF.
     
     PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST: Comparison is made to prior film from 1 day earlier.
     The ETT, NG tube, and central line remain in satisfactory position. Midline
     structures are stable.
     
     The appearance of the lungs is largely without change. There does appear to be
     some interval worsening of aeration in the left base, though this may simply
     represent slightly reduced lung volumes on the current film.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Tubes and catheters in satisfactory position.
     2) No change lungs vs. slight worsening of aeration left base.

Events-  Pt. maintaining MAPs >60 off Levophed gtt.  Echo showing LV diasystolic dysfunction and mild MR.  CRT interupted s/t to alarming "high return pressure"- machine troubleshooted as instructed however this did not allievate the problem and the pt had to be disconnected-  Blue/ "return" port found to be clotted off- TPA injected through line and sat for several hours.  Found to be patent at 1700 and CRT restarted.  Renal fellow and team aware of issues.  

Review of systems-

Neuro-  Propofol gtt off for several hours for daily wake up.  Pt. moving all extremeties, squeezing hands inconsistently to instruction. Became agitated with visitor present and was flalling arms and appeared distress.  However, denied pain.  Pt. repositioned for comfort but this did not relieve agitation.  Propofol restarted at 3:30pm with good effect at previous rate of 20mcg/kg/min.  Will cont to do daily/ BID wake ups per suggestion of Transplant Service.

Resp-  Pt. conts to have green tinged sputum in mod amounts.  Sx'ing required q3-4 hours.  Sx'ing thick/blood from back of throat.  Vent setting changed- increased DP to 25 from 20 to accomodate for worsening metabolic acidosis.  Most recent ABG 7.29/45/129/23 slightly changed from 7.30/46/134/24.  No further vent changes made b/c of little improvment with increased DP.  Pt. tolerating mode with TV variable from 400-500cc, slightly overbreathing to rate of 18-20 (set at 16).  Sat's remain stable >96%.  Do occasionally dip when requiring sx'ing.

CV-  HR 70's NSR.  MAP >60 off levophed.  Hemodynamics-  C.O [**9-22**], PAP 45-60/20-30's with wedge of 28, CVP 26 (? if RV waveform vs. valvular disease causing higher "v" waves).  Swan requiring refloatation by team.  Repositioned at 45cm and obtained wedge pressure of 28 w/ CVP 26.  Heme-  PLT down to 47, HCT 27, would consider giving 6pk if appears to be bleeding (goal >50).  Will repeat labs at 9pm (HCT, PLT, 
e-lytes, ABG with ionized Ca+).  

Endo-  Conts on insulin infusion to keep BS 100-150.  

GI-  ABD obese, oozing from skin folds. TF changed to Nepro w/ Promod at 30cc/hr.  Residuals not exceeding 40cc.  

GU-  U/O 0-20cc/hr.  CRT stopped as mentioned and restarted at 1720.  Consistent problems with pressures from cathter.  Therefore, switched red/blue ports at 1800.  Pls. see flowsheet for objective data.  

ID-  Afebrile.  Conts on Vanco, zosyn, PO diflucan for yeast in urine.  No new cx. data available.  Will need pan cultures drawn if spikes.

     Various lines and tubes are unchanged in position in the interval.  Again
     demonstrated is a bilateral alveolar process, which is widespread but
     relatively spares the left lung apex.  This shows slight interval improvement
     compared to the previous study of earlier the same date.  Cardiac and
     mediastinal contours appear stable.  There is probably a layering right

Resp-  Received on PCV, transitioned to PSV of 20/PEEP 5 50% (will decrease to 40% now) with stable ABGs reflective of metabolic acidosis 7.31/39/165/21 previously 7.42/27/173/18.  Green sputum from high bilirubin conts in mod amounts requiring s'xing q3-4 hours.  Sat's 98%.  To have am CXR to evaluate specifically right side given extreme pleural effusions and white out on [**12-3**].  

CV-  HR 60-75 NSR, BP 100-110/40's.  Hemodynamics- PAP 40-50/20's, wedge 23 at 8am, 20 at 1600- CVP 17 at 8am, 14 at 1600 with C.O 8.74 and 10.2; numbers reflective of volume status and ongoing diuresis on CRT.  Heme-  HCT 29.5, PLT 48.  No signs of active bleeding, no further oozing from IV sites.  Swan remains in awaiting transplants input before d/c'ing.  Appropriately to d/c given that data collected that was in question and pt. is off levophed X 36 hours with improving resp. status/volume status.  Derm-  skin tear noted by left art. line dsg, weeping from areas on abd. no pressure sores noted, areas of ecchymosis throughout upper extremeties.  

GI-  ABD obese, decrease BS, stool ongoing with lactulose.  TF cont at goal of 30cc/hr of Nepro with Promod.  

Endo-  Receving Insulin (regular) infusion at 5u/hr today for BS b/w 100-140. Dipping now to 79, therefore gtt decreased to 1u/hr, will cont to monitor q1-2 hours as indicated.  

GU-  U/O minimal.  CRT conts.  Changed replacment fluid to normocarb to compensate for metabolic acidosis.  

ID-  Vanco, zosyn cont. Fluconozole ordered IV (receiving PO now) awaiting ID approval.  Afebrile.  WBC down to 3.9 today.  Repeat u/a c+s sent to check for yeast.  

Social-  Son, [**Doctor Last Name **] called and updated, will not be visiting given events in [**Location (un) 175**] today, will check in tonight.  [**Doctor Last Name **] lives in [**Location (un) 468**], MA (western MA).  Of note, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 469**] commenting that pt. is currently not a liver transplant candidate given questionable sepsis and body habitus, hope for pt. to be relisted once stablized.

     HISTORY:  Status-post TIPS with abdominal pain.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     Since the prior study of [**3131-4-16**], there has been interval placement of a
     TIPS. The TIPS is patent with wall-to-wall flow. The velocity in the proximal
     aspect of the TIPS (peripheral) is 240.6 cm per second. The velocity in the
     mid-aspect of the TIPS is 176.5 cm per second. The velocity in the distal
     aspect of the TIPS is 217.7 cm per second. It should be noted that the wave
     forms are pulsatile which is also a finding seen in the inferior vena cava.
     This may be on the basis of a hyperdynamic state, however it should be
     clinically correlated for any findings of right heart failure.
     
     As expected, the anterior right portal vein and the left portal vein
     demonstrate reversal of flow. The main portal vein has good flow at 38
     cm/sec.
     
     The hepatic veins are patent.
     
     The liver is coarsened in echo texture consistent with patient's known
     cirrhosis.
     
     There is only a trace of ascites in our four-quadrant evaluation which is in a
     volume too small for aspiration.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Patent TIPS noting presence of pulsatile wave forms; this pulsatility could
     be on the basis of a hyperdynamic state. However it should be correlated
     clinically for findings of right heart failure.
     2) Only trace ascites of a volume too small for aspiration.

     DOPPLER EVALUATION OF THE LIVER:  Comparison is made to the study from [**3131-3-16**].
     Again, the liver is small with a nodular external contour.  There is a small
     amount of ascites anterior to the liver, the amount of which has decreased
     compared to [**4-5**].  The portal vein is patent, but demonstrates bidirectional
     flow.  The right and left portal veins are also both patent.  The hepatic
     venous system and IVC are patent.  The veins demonstrate appropriate
     hepatofugal flow.  No focal masses are seen.  There is intrahepatic or
     extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with a common bile duct measuring 4 mm.
     The spleen is not completely evaluated, but appears enlarged.  The splenic
     echotexture is heterogeneous, raising suspicion for possible infarction.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Patent portal and hepatic venous vasculature.  No ascites or focal mass.
     Splenic enlargemnt with possible infarction.

Date of Birth:   [**3082-1-10**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 623**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49 year old
woman with a history of end stage liver disease secondary to
hepatitis C complicated by esophageal varices as well as a
history of encephalopathy and prior spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 19**] for
management of her ascites.  On that hospitalization multiple
attempts were made to manage her fluid overload with
diuretics, but she was ultimately refractory to them.  She
was referred for TIPS procedure for improved fluid
management.  The patient was readmitted on the day of
admission on [**4-21**] for TIPS.  The procedure was notable for
having somewhat difficult access, but no complications with
an estimated blood loss of 100 cc.  At the procedure she
received 4 mg of Versed, 600 of propofol, 150 of fentanyl.
She had been hemodynamically stable for several hours post
procedure, but then her blood pressure dropped from 100/40 to
70s to 80s over 30s and her heart rate remained sinus tach.
At the time, although her urine output remained strong, she
was transferred to the medical ICU for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hepatitis C genotype 1A complicated by
cirrhosis, esophageal varices, encephalopathy and presumptive
SBP.  Type 2 diabetes.  Obesity.  Hypertension.  Asthma.
Esophageal candidiasis.  Gastroparesis.  Depression.  Status
post cholecystectomy.  Status post seven spur surgeries.
Hypothyroidism.  Amenorrhea.  Migraines.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Protonix 40 mg q.d., Synthroid 100
mcg q.d., Reglan 10 q.i.d., Flovent two puffs b.i.d.,
lactulose 45 ml q.i.d., Ambien 5 mg q.h.s. p.r.n., Levaquin

b.i.d., morphine p.r.n., albuterol one to two puffs q.six
p.r.n., Serevent one puff b.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a prior machine operator on
disability.  She is not married.  She lives with her son.
She has a 15 pack year tobacco history, she quit in October.
She has a history of alcohol use, particularly heavy in the
mid-1980s.  She has a history of IV drug abuse, none since
the 1980s.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.  It does not include liver
disease or bleeding disorder.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's temperature was 98.5,
pulse 96, BP 95/48, respiratory rate 16, sating 98 percent on
3 liters.  In general, she was a pleasant, middle aged woman
lying in no acute distress.  Head and neck exams showed
normocephalic, atraumatic head with pupils equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Oropharynx was slightly dry.  On neck exam she had a
right central venous line with mild ooze.  Heart was
tachycardiac with regular rhythm, no murmurs.  Lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly.  Abdomen was
soft, nondistended, nontender with active bowel sounds.  She
had guaiac positive stool.  Extremities had 2+ edema to the
knees.  On neuro exam she was alert and oriented times three.
Cranial nerves II-XII were grossly intact.  Strength and
sensation were grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 3.7, hematocrit 26.8, platelets
43.  PTT 39.5, INR 1.5.  Sodium 126, potassium 4.4, chloride
94, bicarb 26, BUN 31, creatinine 1.2, glucose 136.  Calcium
7.5, mag 1.2, phos 3.7.  AST 174, ALT 80, alka phos 126,
t-bili 3.1, LDH 255.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Hypotension.  The patient was admitted to the MICU for
hypotension.  The underlying etiology was not initially
clear, although the differential included excess anesthesia
from the procedure, particularly given her liver disease
versus hypovolemia from a hemorrhage, either around the liver
into the abdomen or within the GI tract versus sepsis.  She
was started empirically on antibiotics with levo and Flagyl.
She had an abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for ascites for
possible paracentesis.  There was no ascites.  She was
maintained on antibiotic prophylaxis for several days.  She
was transfused one unit of packed cells and given fluids to
improve her blood pressure and it responded appropriately.
She was started on Neo-Synephrine to keep her MAPS greater
than 55.  It took several days, but this was ultimately
weaned.  The entire time she had excellent urine output.  As
cultures continued to be negative and the patient had no
fever or white count, she was not maintained SBP antibiotic
coverage and once she was maintained on pressors, she was
able to be transferred out to the floor.  She had no further
evidence of hypotension while on the medicine floor.

2.  Hypoxia/congestive heart failure.  The patient was given
vigorous IV fluids hydration and blood during her MICU stay.
She subsequently became progressively hypoxic with diffuse
wheezing and a chest film that was consistent with fluid
overload.  She was started with diuresis once she was on the
medicine floor with rapid improvement in her hypoxia and her
lung exam.  Once the pulmonary edema was improved, her
exercise tolerance improved dramatically.

3.  Pulmonary.  The patient does have a history of asthma and
she was wheezing significantly when she hit the floor.  She
responded well to IV Lasix and frequent nebulizer treatments.
These will be continued as an outpatient per her
prehospitalization regimen.

4.  Status post TIPS.  The patient did not have any evidence
of encephalopathy and her abdominal distention improved
significantly over the course of her admission.  She was
between 2 and 3 liters negative per day and did not have an
untoward effects with respect to her renal failure.

5.  Renal.  The patient's creatinine slightly increased on
admission to the ICU.  However, over the course of her
admission, her creatinine went down to 1.0 by discharge which
is as good, if not better, than her typical baseline.

6.  Infectious disease.  When the patient was out on the
floor, she did not show any evidence of infection.  She was
continued on SBP prophylaxis regimen of Levaquin q.day.

7.  Endocrine.  The patient was continued on her diabetes
regimen with glargine and a sliding scale.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with VNA for home safety
evaluation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  End stage liver disease.
2.  Hepatitis C.
3.  Anasarca.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Flovent two puffs b.i.d.
2.  Albuterol one to two puffs q.six hours p.r.n.
3.  Serevent one puff b.i.d.

     intolerant to diuretics. Total bilirubin of 3 mg/dl, mild encephalopathy.
     Request for creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
     (TIPS).
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 132**] [**Name (STitle) 107**] d'Othee and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 320**] [**Name (STitle) 321**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 107**]
     [**Name (STitle) 108**], staff radiologist, was present for the entire procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure.
     The patient was placed supine on the angiography table and MAC anesthesia was
     started by the Anesthesiology Team. Focused ultrasonic examination of the
     abdomen showed a mild to moderate amount of fluid around the liver. Therefore,
     no paracentesis was attempted.
     
     The right supraclavicular area and right side of the neck were sterilely
     draped and prepped as usually. Using real-time ultrasound guidance, the right
     internal jugular vein was accessed with a 21 gauge needle after subcutaneous
     infiltration of lidocaine 1% for local anesthesia. An 0.018 guidewire was
     advanced under fluoroscopic guidance up to the right atrium and the needle was
     exchanged for a 4.5 French micropuncture sheath. An 0.035 standard guidewire
     was advanced through the sheath into inferior vena cava (IVC) and the
     percutaneous access tract was dilated over the wire until it accomodated a
     long, 10 French sheath, the sidearm of which was connected to continuous
     irrigation with normal saline.
     
     The right hepatic vein was accessed with a Cobra C2 Glidecatheter and an 0.035
     glidewire. After exchange for an 0.035 SuperStiff Amplatz wire, the tip of the
     sheath was advanced under fluoroscopy into the right hepatic vein over the
     wire and its dilator. A 5 French balloon occlusion catheter was then
     positioned in the right hepatic vein and inflated in a wedge position. A wedge
     hepatic venogram was obtained by using carbon dioxide (CO2) as contrast [**Doctor Last Name 322**].
     This was done in both posterior anterior and lateral projections. These two
     wedge hepatic venograms showed opacification of the peripheral portion of the
     right hepatic vein, parenchymography in the corresponding right hepatic
     territory, and retrograde opacification of the right and left branches of the
     portal vein and their branches, as well as opacification of the main trunk of
     the portal vein. It also allowed to precise the relationship between the right
     hepatic vein and the right branch of the portal vein.
                                                                 (Over)

     The balloon occlusion catheter was deflated and removed and attempts were made
     to create the intrahepatic shunt with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 323**] needle introduced through
     the sheath into the right hepatic vein. Inadvertent puncture and opacification
     of the right intrahepatic duct was done, and showed opacification of some
     intrahepatic bile ducts as well as the common hepatic duct. Using this
     landmark, the right branch of the portal vein was then easily punctured with
     the needle, and an 0.035 stiff Glidewire was advanced into the main trunk of
     the portal vein and the splenic vein.
     
     The needle was removed over the wire and exchanged for a 5 French straight
     multi-sidehole catheter through which iodinated contrast portogram was
     performed. This portogram in the PA projection showed opacification of the
     main portal vein and its intrahepatic branches, as well as splenic and
     inferior mesenteric veins. No gastric varices were seen.
     
     The catheter was then exchanged over a wire for a 10 x 40 mm balloon, which
     was inflated at the level of the intrahepatic tract. The balloon catheter was
     exchanged over the wire for the 5 French straight multisidehole catheter
     again, and an additional postero-anterior portogram was obtained and showed
     the same findings as above, and provided landmarks for future stent placement.
     
     A 10 x 68 mm Wallstent was then positioned under fluoroscopy between the
     intrahepatic portion of the right portal branch and the right hepatic vein.
     The stent was briefly dilated with the 10 mm balloon. A control portogram was
     obtained, with the tip of the catheter positioned in the main portal vein. It
     showed good positioning and good flow within the stent, which extends from the
     intrahepatic portion of the right portal branch and the right hepatic vein.
     Most of the contrast was flowing through the shunt, with only minimal
     opacification of the central portions of the right and left portal veins.
     
     Transcatheter pressure measurement taken prior to creation of the TIPS showed
     a mean pressure 45 mm Hg in the main portal vein and 21 mm Hg in the right
     hepatic vein.
     
     The catheter and 10 French sheath were then removed into the superior vena
     cava, and the sheath was exchanged over a wire for a 4-lumen, 8.5 French
     central venous catheter. An x-ray was taken and showed good positioning of the
     catheter, with its tip at the level of the right atrium. The catheter was
     sutured to the skin with two stitches. A sterile dressing was applied.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
     immediate complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS: Total of 400 ml of nonionic contrast (Optiray 320) IV. Lidocaine
                                                                 (Over)

     CONCLUSIONS:
     
     1. Creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) (10 x 68
     mm Wallstent) between the right hepatic vein and the intrahepatic portion of
     the right branch of the portal vein. Good patency and flow through the shunt
     on end-procedural venograms.
     
     2. A four lumen, 8.5 French central venous catheter was left in place to the
     right intrajugular vein access.

     The balloon occlusion catheter was deflated and removed and attempts were made
     to create the intrahepatic shunt with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 323**] needle introduced through
     the sheath into the right hepatic vein. Inadvertent puncture and opacification
     of the right intrahepatic duct was done, and showed opacification of some
     intrahepatic bile ducts as well as the common hepatic duct. Using this
     landmark, the right branch of the portal vein was then easily punctured with
     the needle, and an 0.035 stiff Glidewire was advanced into the main trunk of
     the portal vein and the splenic vein.
     
     The needle was removed over the wire and exchanged for a 5 French straight
     multi-sidehole catheter through which iodinated contrast portogram was
     performed. This portogram in the PA projection showed opacification of the
     main portal vein and its intrahepatic branches, as well as splenic and
     inferior mesenteric veins. No gastric varices were seen.
     
     The catheter was then exchanged over a wire for a 10 x 40 mm balloon, which
     was inflated at the level of the intrahepatic tract. The balloon catheter was
     exchanged over the wire for the 5 French straight multisidehole catheter
     again, and an additional postero-anterior portogram was obtained and showed
     the same findings as above, and provided landmarks for future stent placement.
     
     A 10 x 68 mm Wallstent was then positioned under fluoroscopy between the
     intrahepatic portion of the right portal branch and the right hepatic vein.
     The stent was briefly dilated with the 10 mm balloon. A control portogram was
     obtained, with the tip of the catheter positioned in the main portal vein. It
     showed good positioning and good flow within the stent, which extends from the
     intrahepatic portion of the right portal branch and the right hepatic vein.
     Most of the contrast was flowing through the shunt, with only minimal
     opacification of the central portions of the right and left portal veins.
     
     Transcatheter pressure measurement taken prior to creation of the TIPS showed
     a mean pressure 45 mm Hg in the main portal vein and 21 mm Hg in the right
     hepatic vein.
     
     The catheter and 10 French sheath were then removed into the superior vena
     cava, and the sheath was exchanged over a wire for a 4-lumen, 8.5 French
     central venous catheter. An x-ray was taken and showed good positioning of the
     catheter, with its tip at the level of the right atrium. The catheter was
     sutured to the skin with two stitches. A sterile dressing was applied.

     INDICATION: 49-year-old woman with refractory ascites and hyponatremia,
     intolerant to diuretics. Total bilirubin of 3 mg/dl, mild encephalopathy.
     Request for creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
     (TIPS).
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 132**] [**Name (STitle) 107**] d'Othee and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 320**] [**Name (STitle) 321**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 107**]
     [**Name (STitle) 108**], staff radiologist, was present for the entire procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure.
     The patient was placed supine on the angiography table and MAC anesthesia was
     started by the Anesthesiology Team. Focused ultrasonic examination of the
     abdomen showed a mild to moderate amount of fluid around the liver. Therefore,
     no paracentesis was attempted.
     
     The right supraclavicular area and right side of the neck were sterilely
     draped and prepped as usually. Using real-time ultrasound guidance, the right
     internal jugular vein was accessed with a 21 gauge needle after subcutaneous
     infiltration of lidocaine 1% for local anesthesia. An 0.018 guidewire was
     advanced under fluoroscopic guidance up to the right atrium and the needle was
     exchanged for a 4.5 French micropuncture sheath. An 0.035 standard guidewire
     was advanced through the sheath into inferior vena cava (IVC) and the
     percutaneous access tract was dilated over the wire until it accomodated a
     long, 10 French sheath, the sidearm of which was connected to continuous
     irrigation with normal saline.
     
     The right hepatic vein was accessed with a Cobra C2 Glidecatheter and an 0.035
     glidewire. After exchange for an 0.035 SuperStiff Amplatz wire, the tip of the
     sheath was advanced under fluoroscopy into the right hepatic vein over the
     wire and its dilator. A 5 French balloon occlusion catheter was then
     positioned in the right hepatic vein and inflated in a wedge position. A wedge
     hepatic venogram was obtained by using carbon dioxide (CO2) as contrast [**Doctor Last Name 322**].
     This was done in both posterior anterior and lateral projections. These two
     wedge hepatic venograms showed opacification of the peripheral portion of the
     right hepatic vein, parenchymography in the corresponding right hepatic
     territory, and retrograde opacification of the right and left branches of the
     portal vein and their branches, as well as opacification of the main trunk of
     the portal vein. It also allowed to precise the relationship between the right
     hepatic vein and the right branch of the portal vein.

     INDICATION: 49-year-old woman with refractory ascites and hyponatremia,
     intolerant to diuretics. Total bilirubin of 3 mg/dl, mild encephalopathy.
     Request for creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
     (TIPS).
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 132**] [**Name (STitle) 107**] d'Othee and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 320**] [**Name (STitle) 321**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 107**]
     [**Name (STitle) 108**], staff radiologist, was present for the entire procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure.
     The patient was placed supine on the angiography table and MAC anesthesia was
     started by the Anesthesiology Team. Focused ultrasonic examination of the
     abdomen showed a mild to moderate amount of fluid around the liver. Therefore,
     no paracentesis was attempted.
     
     The right supraclavicular area and right side of the neck were sterilely
     draped and prepped as usually. Using real-time ultrasound guidance, the right
     internal jugular vein was accessed with a 21 gauge needle after subcutaneous
     infiltration of lidocaine 1% for local anesthesia. An 0.018 guidewire was
     advanced under fluoroscopic guidance up to the right atrium and the needle was
     exchanged for a 4.5 French micropuncture sheath. An 0.035 standard guidewire
     was advanced through the sheath into inferior vena cava (IVC) and the
     percutaneous access tract was dilated over the wire until it accomodated a
     long, 10 French sheath, the sidearm of which was connected to continuous
     irrigation with normal saline.
     
     The right hepatic vein was accessed with a Cobra C2 Glidecatheter and an 0.035
     glidewire. After exchange for an 0.035 SuperStiff Amplatz wire, the tip of the
     sheath was advanced under fluoroscopy into the right hepatic vein over the
     wire and its dilator. A 5 French balloon occlusion catheter was then
     positioned in the right hepatic vein and inflated in a wedge position. A wedge
     hepatic venogram was obtained by using carbon dioxide (CO2) as contrast [**Doctor Last Name 322**].
     This was done in both posterior anterior and lateral projections. These two
     wedge hepatic venograms showed opacification of the peripheral portion of the
     right hepatic vein, parenchymography in the corresponding right hepatic
     territory, and retrograde opacification of the right and left branches of the
     portal vein and their branches, as well as opacification of the main trunk of
     the portal vein. It also allowed to precise the relationship between the right
     hepatic vein and the right branch of the portal vein.
                                                                 (Over)

     The balloon occlusion catheter was deflated and removed and attempts were made
     to create the intrahepatic shunt with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 323**] needle introduced through
     the sheath into the right hepatic vein. Inadvertent puncture and opacification
     of the right intrahepatic duct was done, and showed opacification of some
     intrahepatic bile ducts as well as the common hepatic duct. Using this
     landmark, the right branch of the portal vein was then easily punctured with
     the needle, and an 0.035 stiff Glidewire was advanced into the main trunk of
     the portal vein and the splenic vein.
     
     The needle was removed over the wire and exchanged for a 5 French straight
     multi-sidehole catheter through which iodinated contrast portogram was
     performed. This portogram in the PA projection showed opacification of the
     main portal vein and its intrahepatic branches, as well as splenic and
     inferior mesenteric veins. No gastric varices were seen.
     
     The catheter was then exchanged over a wire for a 10 x 40 mm balloon, which
     was inflated at the level of the intrahepatic tract. The balloon catheter was
     exchanged over the wire for the 5 French straight multisidehole catheter
     again, and an additional postero-anterior portogram was obtained and showed
     the same findings as above, and provided landmarks for future stent placement.
     
     A 10 x 68 mm Wallstent was then positioned under fluoroscopy between the
     intrahepatic portion of the right portal branch and the right hepatic vein.
     The stent was briefly dilated with the 10 mm balloon. A control portogram was
     obtained, with the tip of the catheter positioned in the main portal vein. It
     showed good positioning and good flow within the stent, which extends from the
     intrahepatic portion of the right portal branch and the right hepatic vein.
     Most of the contrast was flowing through the shunt, with only minimal
     opacification of the central portions of the right and left portal veins.
     
     Transcatheter pressure measurement taken prior to creation of the TIPS showed
     a mean pressure 45 mm Hg in the main portal vein and 21 mm Hg in the right
     hepatic vein.
     
     The catheter and 10 French sheath were then removed into the superior vena
     cava, and the sheath was exchanged over a wire for a 4-lumen, 8.5 French
     central venous catheter. An x-ray was taken and showed good positioning of the
     catheter, with its tip at the level of the right atrium. The catheter was
     sutured to the skin with two stitches. A sterile dressing was applied.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
     immediate complications.

     catheter, with its tip at the level of the right atrium. The catheter was
     sutured to the skin with two stitches. A sterile dressing was applied.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
     immediate complications.

     CONCLUSIONS:
     
     1. Creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) (10 x 68
     mm Wallstent) between the right hepatic vein and the intrahepatic portion of
     the right branch of the portal vein. Good patency and flow through the shunt
     on end-procedural venograms.
     
     2. A four lumen, 8.5 French central venous catheter was left in place to the
     right intrajugular vein access.

     COMPARISON:  [**3131-5-13**].
     
     LIVER DOPPLER:  The liver again demonstrates diffusely coarsened echotexture
     with a nodular appearance.  TIPS shunt is identified with wall-to-wall color
     flow.  Peak velocities in the proximal, mid and distal shunt are 55 cm/sec,
     150 cm/sec and 160 cm/sec, respectively.  These are similar to the most recent
     prior study.  A peak velocity of 60 cm/sec is noted in the main portal vein.
     There is appropriate direction of flow in the main portal vein.  There is
     expected reversal of flow in the anterior division of the right portal vein
     and left portal vein.  The hepatic veins are patent.  Normal hepatic arterial
     flow is identified throughout the liver.  There is no ascites.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance and flow characteristics within TIPS shunt.
     Velocities ranging from 55 to 160 cm/sec within the shunt.

     velocities are 66 and 215, respectively.  Velocities at the mid-shunt were
     unable to be well evaluated.  Appropriate hepatofugal flow in the left and
     right anterior portal veins is noted.  The hepatic arteries and veins are
     patent.  A very small amount of ascites is seen.  A moderate right pleural
     effusion is noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Patent TIPS with wall-to wall hepatopetal flow.  Flow rates from
     66 to 215 centimeters per second.

     Compared to previous study of [**12-3**].
     
     INDICATION: S/P paracentesis. Intubation. Pulmonary edema.
     
     Allowing for flexed position of the patient's neck, an ETT is probably within
     satisfactory position. An NG tube, Swan-Ganz catheter and right PICC line are
     noted. The PICC line has a relatively low position, extending into the
     proximal right atrium. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable
     allowing for patient rotation and differences in positioning between the 2
     studies. There has been interval development of vascular engorgement and
     perihilar haziness. There has been overall improved aeration in the right
     lung, however, which was previously densely opacified. A large right pleural
     effusion is noted and there is probably a small to moderate pleural effusion
     on the left as well. Diffuse haziness is noted in the imaged portion of the
     abdomen suggestive of ascites.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Interval improved aeration of the right lung which was
     previously completely consolidated.
     
     2) Bilateral perihilar haziness suggesting pulmonary edema.
     
     3) Large right and small to moderate left pleural effusions.
     
     4) Low position of PICC line.

     PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Comparison is made to [**3131-12-2**]. The newly inserted
     endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position in the mid trachea.  There is a
     crescentic lucency along the right paraspinal line which is not definitely
     located within the trachea, and which is suspicious for pneumomediastiunm. An
     NG tube is present with the tip below the left hemidiaphragm. The right
     internal jugular approach swan ganz catheter has been advanced and the tip is
     located to far peripherally within a right lower lobe pulmonary artery branch.
     This should be retracted several cm. A right PICC tip is in the region of the
     distal SVC, unchanged.  There is worsening opacity in the right hemithorax
     which is likely due to an enlarging effusion and associated atelectasis.  A
     small portion of the right middle lobe remains aerated.
     
     IMPRESSION
     
     1.  ET tube located appropriately within the mid trachea. Possible
     pneumomediastinum. Repeat upright AP study reccommended.
     2.  Swan ganz catheter tip within a branch of the right lower lobe pulmonary

     INDICATION: End stage liver disease and renal failure.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 351**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 126**]
     with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 126**], the attending radiologist being present and supervising
     throughout. After discussion of the risks and benefits with the patient's
     health care proxy, telephone consent was obtained. Prior to the procedure the
     patient received two units of platelets, four units of FFP and cryoprecipitate
     given the patient's coagulopathy.  The left neck was prepped and draped in the
     standard sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was achieved with subcutaneous
     injection of approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine. The left internal jugular
     vein was found to be patent and compressible by ultrasound. The left internal
     jugular vein was then accessed using a 21 gauge needle under ultrasonographic
     guidance. A 0.018 guide wire was passed into the internal jugular vein and
     into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance using a portable C-
     arm, at the patient's bedside.  Following a skin [**Doctor Last Name 352**] with a scalpel blade,
     the puncture needle was then exchanged for a 4 French catheter sheath with
     inner dilator. The guide wire and inner sheath were then exchanged for a 0.035
     guide wire which was then advanced into the inferior vena cava under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  The track was sequentially dilated up to a 14 French
     dilator.  A 14.5 French sheath was then advanced over the wire.  The wire and
     inner dilator were then exchanged for the hemodialysis catheter.  The sheath
     was then removed. The tip of the catheter was demonstrated to be within the
     right atrium under fluoroscopy.  The line was flushed and heplocked. The
     catheter was then secured with 0-silk sutures.  The exit site was covered with
     Gelfoam and a pressure dressing.  The patient tolerated the procedure well
     with no immediate post procedural complications.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 14.5 French dual-lumen temporary
     dialysis catheter via the left internal jugular vein with the tip at the
     cavoatrial junction  ready for use.

     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 351**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 126**]
     with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 126**], the attending radiologist being present and supervising
     throughout. After discussion of the risks and benefits with the patient's
     health care proxy, telephone consent was obtained. Prior to the procedure the
     patient received two units of platelets, four units of FFP and cryoprecipitate
     given the patient's coagulopathy.  The left neck was prepped and draped in the
     standard sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was achieved with subcutaneous
     injection of approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine. The left internal jugular
     vein was found to be patent and compressible by ultrasound. The left internal
     jugular vein was then accessed using a 21 gauge needle under ultrasonographic
     guidance. A 0.018 guide wire was passed into the internal jugular vein and
     into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance using a portable C-
     arm, at the patient's bedside.  Following a skin [**Doctor Last Name 352**] with a scalpel blade,
     the puncture needle was then exchanged for a 4 French catheter sheath with
     inner dilator. The guide wire and inner sheath were then exchanged for a 0.035
     guide wire which was then advanced into the inferior vena cava under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  The track was sequentially dilated up to a 14 French
     dilator.  A 14.5 French sheath was then advanced over the wire.  The wire and
     inner dilator were then exchanged for the hemodialysis catheter.  The sheath
     was then removed. The tip of the catheter was demonstrated to be within the
     right atrium under fluoroscopy.  The line was flushed and heplocked. The
     catheter was then secured with 0-silk sutures.  The exit site was covered with
     Gelfoam and a pressure dressing.  The patient tolerated the procedure well
     with no immediate post procedural complications.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 14.5 French dual-lumen temporary
     dialysis catheter via the left internal jugular vein with the tip at the
     cavoatrial junction  ready for use.

NPN 7a-7p

Events-  Pt. fairly stable day re: VS.  Conts to require levophed at small doses 0.025 or less.  Hemodynamics essentially unchanged, conts to be swaned for wedge pressure monitoring.  Had HD line placed at bedside with IR team and fluoroscopy/ u/s guidance.  Afternoon HCT 21.2- will transfuse 2u PRBC.  Received 4u FFP and 2 pk of PLT for coagulopathy in the setting of needing HD line.  Currently awaiting HD orders and pharamacy to mix HD bags. 

Review of Systems-

Neuro-  Propofol gtt remains at 20mcg/kg/min- pt. easily arouses with turning and sx'ing.  Daily wake up done and pt. was able to move all extremeties not necessarily on command.  Pt. medicated with MSO4 1.5mg during IR procedure for pain management.  

Resp-  Pt. Inspiratory Pressure set at 25 - PEEP of 5 to give a Driving Pressure of 20, RR set at 16 with TV b/w 350-450cc, 50%.  ABG 7.40/46/121/30, no further vent changes made.  Sx'd for bilious colored ETT secretions and bloody oral secretions.  Mouth with some tongue and oral ulcerations.  LS- increased on right side w/ coarse sounds throughout.  Sat's remain stable.  Was placed on 100% for procedure.

CV-  HR 60-70 NSR with some pausing noted on bedside monitor during placement of HD line.  BP stable on levophed and able to come down a bit today to 0.025 or less ranging from MAP of 60-70.  Swan remains at 50cm despite being recorded early at 54cm, able to wedge, but it appears that RA trace is really RV trace.  Wedge is 22-23, CVP/RV 20-23, C.O 7.09-7.37, SVR 643-488.  HCT 25 at start of shift, dipped to 21.2, will transfuse w/ 2u PRBC and recheck HCT after infusions complete.  As mentioned above, pt. received 2 6pk of PLT and 4u FFP prior to line placement.  Pt. still having some oozing around site of new catheter, gel foam and pressure applied.  goals- PLT >50 (if bleeding, if not will monitor trend), INR <2.0, HCT >27.  Derm-  skin intact with some areas of bruising noted on upper arms? pettichae vs. ecchymosis.  

GI-  ABD obese, hypoactive BS, had 700cc of stool out this shift, conts on lactulose.  TF to start when available, nepro with promod goal of 30cc/hr.

Endo-  Requiring Insulin infusion from 2.5-3.5u/hr to keep BS b/w 80-120.    

GU-  U/O 0-5cc/hr.  To start CRT tonight when dialysate solutions available.  Renal fellow to be placing orders in POE now.

ID-  AFebrile.  Fully cultured on admission.  Awaiting pleural fluid cultures and other data.  Remains on Vanco and zosyn.  Appears that the source of infection/sepsis is lung s/t ? asp. pneumonia s/t encephalopathy.

Social- son called, updated on plan of care and says he will be in this evening, if calls again, would suggest coming in tom'row vs. tonight given need to start CRT.

     INDICATION:  49 year old woman with hepatic encephalopathy, ascites,
     intubated.  Evaluation of lung fields.
     
     COMPARISON:  Semi-upright AP portable chest x-ray from [**3131-12-7**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP portable chest x-ray.
     
     FINDINGS:  Since the prior study, the pulmonary artery catheter has been
     removed.  The left internal jugular venous cordis is in unchanged position
     with its tip lying at the junction between the right atrium and distal SVC.
     The right IJ sheath lies in similar position with its tip in the
     brachiocephalic vein.  The ETT remains in satisfactory position.  The course
     of the NGT is similar to before.  Its tip is visualized in the right upper
     quadrant in a similar position to its original site of placement, likely in
     the stomach.  The PICC line is in unchanged position.
     
     The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged, allowing for technique
     differences.  There is an unchanged layering pleural effusion on the right.  A
     small pleural effusion also persists on the left.  Improvement in the degree
     of pulmonary edema is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Removal of pulmonary artery catheter.
     2)  Somewhat low position of left subclavian venous sheath and right PICC
     line.
     3)  Interval improvement in pulmonary edema.
     4)  Persistent large right-sided layering pleural effusion, with small to
     moderate left pleural effusion.

     PROCEDURE:  5 French dual-lumen PICC line placement via right basilic vein
     approach; ultrasound-guided venipuncture.
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  74-year-old man with ALS, needs IV access for blood draws
     and hydration
     
     OPERATORS:

     2.  [**Name6 (MD) 54**] [**Name8 (MD) 55**], M.D. (supervising staff)
     
     DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Timeout was performed to identify the patient, the
     procedure to be performed, the site of the procedure, and appropriate
     requisition.  Once the above were verified, the patient was positioned in
     supine fashion on a special procedures/angiography table with the right arm
     abducted, externally rotated, and prepped and draped from the axilla to the
     forearm.  A tourniquet was applied to the upper arm.  Ultrasound was employed
     using usual aseptic precautions for assessment of the venous anatomy of the
     right upper extremity.  The right basilic vein was noted to be widely patent
     and compressible and suitable for venipuncture.  The skin was then infiltrated
     with approximately 3 cc of 1% buffered Xylocaine for local anesthesia.  Under
     ultrasound guidance, uneventful one-wall retrograde venipuncture of the right
     basilic vein was achieved easily.  (Static sonographic images were obtained
     both prior to and after the venipuncture.)  A guidewire was advanced through
     the access needle and delivered to the level of caudal superior vena cava
     using flouroscopic guidance. The intravascular length of the catheter was then
     determined at 40 cm. The catheter was tailored accordingly.  The catheter was
     then delivered using modified Seldinger technique to the caudal superior vena
     cava. Once satisfactory positioning was confirmed, the catheter was secured in
     place at the skin using a StatLock device.  The puncture site and StatLock
     device were overlaid with transparent Tegaderm semi-occlusive dressing.
     Estimated blood loss was minimal.  No immediate complications were
     encountered.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate
     complication.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Status post successful placement of 5 French dual-lumen PICC line
     placement via right basilic vein approach.  Final catheter length is 40 cm.
     Tip position is in caudal superior vena cava.  The catheter is ready to

     both prior to and after the venipuncture.)  A guidewire was advanced through
     the access needle and delivered to the level of caudal superior vena cava
     using flouroscopic guidance. The intravascular length of the catheter was then
     determined at 40 cm. The catheter was tailored accordingly.  The catheter was
     then delivered using modified Seldinger technique to the caudal superior vena
     cava. Once satisfactory positioning was confirmed, the catheter was secured in
     place at the skin using a StatLock device.  The puncture site and StatLock
     device were overlaid with transparent Tegaderm semi-occlusive dressing.
     Estimated blood loss was minimal.  No immediate complications were
     encountered.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate
     complication.

MICU NPN 0700-1930:
  Events:  Cordis changed over wire to TLC.  Prior to procedure, coagulopathy corrected with 1 u plts and 3 u FFP.  After line changed (despite purse suture), site bleeding briskly.  Manual pressure held X 25 minutes, gelfoam and pressure dressing applied to site.  Bleeding appears to have stopped.  2 u FFP and 1 u cryo ordered as pt now bleeding from HD line and mouth.  In process of transfusing blood products, pt clotted off CVVH--will contact renal fellow about restarting therapy.

  Neuro:  Pt more awake today, opening eyes spontaneously and following commands consistantly.  Localizing ETT, bilat soft wrist restraints maintained for safety while intubated.


  CV:  Pt initially slightly hypothermic--bairhugger on for the morning and pt warmed up to 98 range.  Pt in NSR, rate 70's-90's.  BP stable.  Pt tollerating CVVH with -100 cc fluid goal.  -1.5 liters at 1600, but slightly more positive after blood products.  More K+ added to the bags, and pt repleted X 1 with 40 meq kcl PO.

  Pulm:  Pt completed PSV 5/5 and then 5/0 trials today with excellent ABG's.  However, decision made by the team that pt was not awake enough to extubate.  They will wait one more day and prob attempt extubation in am.  Lungs course.  Pt suctioned q 1-2 hours for mod amts thick yellow tinged sputum.  Copious oral secretions.

  GI:  Pt tollerating goal TF at 30 cc/hr (nepro with promod).  Abd benign with + BS.  Pt stooling via mushroom catheter.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 628**] 
Chief Complaint:
Weakness
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. endotracheal intubation
2. central venous catheter placement
 
History of Present Illness:
74 y/o M w/past hx of HTN and cervical radiculopathy, who 
presented today c/o weakness. He stated that he thought he had 
the flu over the past few days, with a nonproductive cough, 
headache, and general weakness. Very poor PO intake. He was 
recently prescribed effexor, and took his first dose this AM. 
Approximately one hour after that, he felt much weaker. EMS was 
called and on arrival his bp was 80/60. He received 1 L NS and 
his bp responded to 120s.  

On arrival to the ED, his bp was 110s-120s/60s with a pulse in 
the 60s. He was awake, alert, and answering questions. His only 
complaints were of a headache, and he felt like he had to 
urinate but was unable to. He denied any chest pain, shortness 
of breath, abdominal pain. Mild nausea but no vomiting. While 
examining him, he became bradycardic to 42 and hypotensive to 
60/40. He was febrile to 101.2 and diaphoretic. He received 2L 
NS wide open with a mild response in his bp to 70s/50s. He was 
put on peripheral dopamine. Bedside echo revealed no pericardial 
effusion, possibly depressed EF, no visible aortic aneurysm, and 
a dilated IVC. He was taken urgently to CT scan to r/o PE and 
dissection.  

In the CT scanner, he vomited. no aspiration observed and CXR no 
infiltrate. No blood in vomit. He then became tachycardic to the 
130s (narrow complex) which appeared to be SVT per ED resident 
no ECG confirmation in CT. Dopamine stopped with normalization 
of HR. He then again became tachycardic in the 130s, and this 
time broke with carotid massage back down to 70. Still 
hypotensive in 70s and so started on neo. CT showed no PE or 
dissection.  

When he returned, intubated for airway protection given vomiting 
and hemodynamic instability. Never hypoxic or with resp 
distress.  Good mentation per family. vanc/levoflox/flagyl and 
decadron. Lactate was 1.6 and he had 1600 cc UOP. His SBP came 
back up to the 160s and the neo was weaned off. Multiple 
attempts at right subclavian caused 2 arterial sticks. CXR 
showed no pneumo/hemothorax.

Subsequently became hypotensive again, and placed back on neo 
and dopa.  Right IJ placed.  Sent to CCU. Given total of 3 
liters NS.

Recently had epidural steroid inject ion [**2-8**]. No worsening of 
back pain since that time.

 
Past Medical History:
1. HTN  
2. Cervical radiculopathy  
3. Low back pain s/p lumbar epidural steroid injection [**12-24**]

8.6, Mg 1.8, Ph 2.9.
.
Microbiology:
[**2-10**] Blood culture: pending.
[**2-10**] Urine culuture: negative.
[**2-11**] DFA for influenza: negative.
.
Imaging:
[**2-10**] CXR:
Clear lungs.
[**2-10**] CT chest/abdomen/pelvis:
1. No evidence for pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
2. Focal mesenteric region of increased attenuation which most 
likely represents inflammation secondary to mesenteric 
panniculitis, or less likely trauma, edema, or tumor (lymphoma). 
There is no evidence of mesenteric vasculature or bowel 
compromise. A biopsy or CT scan in the future may provide 
further diagnostic information.
3. Fluid within the esophagus which increases this patient's 
risk of aspiration.
4. Multiple low-attenuation lesions throughout the liver which 
most likely represent simple liver cysts; however, an ultrasound 
examination could be performed for confirmation when the patient 
is clinically stabilized.
[**2-12**] TTE:
Conclusions:  
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal 
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with 
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral 
valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion.   
IMPRESSION: Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve 
morphology. Preserved global and regional biventricular systolic 
function.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
74 M with fever and hypotension intubated electively for airway 
protection.
.
# Hypotension:
He was hypotensive in the emergency department which was of 
unclear etiology.  This was thought most likely to be due to 
hypovolemia due to dehydration as his blood pressure normalized 
with IV fluids.  By the end of his hospitalization he had 
actually started to become hypertensive and was started on 
lisinopril 10 mg daily.  His HCTZ was not restarted as it was 
thought this may have been contributing to his hyponatremia. 
.
Fever:
This was of unclear etiology and was attributed to a likely 
viral syndrome.  He had no localizing signs or symptoms of 
infection.  A test for influenza was negative as was a urine 
culture.  Blood cultures were pending at discharge.  He was 
initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics including 
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole.  Once his culture 
data was negative he was switched to po levofloxacin and he was 
discharged to complete a seven day course.
.
# Resp Failure:
He was intubated in the ED for airway protection but he was 
successfully extubated shortly after arriving to the MICU and 
maintained a normal O2 saturation throughout the rest of his 
hospital course.
.
# Hyponatremia:
On admission he was initially hyponatremic with a sodium of 129. 
 This was thought to be due to a combination of hypovolemia from 
dehydration as well as HCTX effect.  With hydration and stopping 
his HCTZ his sodium normalized and at discharge it was 134.
.
# Cervical radiculopathy:
He has a history of this and was last seen in neurology clinic 
in [**2649**].  He intermittently complained of neck pain during his 
admission and was set up with a follow-up appointment in 
neurology with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4198**] on [**3-24**] at 3:00.
.
# Lower back pain:
He has a history of chronic lower back pain and spinal stenosis 
and has been followed in the pain management center.  He was 
kept on his gabapentin and has a follow-up appointment with the 
pain clinic.
.
# Urinary hesitancy:
This is also a chronic issue for him and he was started on 
tamsulosin during his hospitalization with some effect.  He has 
a follow-up appointment in the urology clinic.
.
# Focal mesenteric thickening on CT scan:
His abdominal exam was benign and he did not complain of 
abdominal pain.  The general surgery service was consulted and 
did not recommend any intervention.
.
# Dispo:
He was discharged to home with plans for home physical therapy 
as he had previously had.  He was also set up for appointments 
with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pain clinic, urology, and neurology.

NPN 1900-0700:

EVENTS: Required mild sedation. Increased bleeding. CVVHDF restarted. Bursts of SVT with agitation. 

ROS:
NEURO: At start of shift pt noted to be tachypneic to 30's, restless, having bursts of SVT despite normal lytes, generally uncomfortable-appearing. Inconsistent in answering questions or following commands, but denied pain. Given 30mg bolus of propofol with good effect; required one more dose at 0400. Transient hypotension after dose resolved without intervention. She is now lethargic but easily aroused, answering questions and following commands inconsistently. Overall, despite being more awake, her MS seems to have worsened, likely d/t hepatic encephalopathy, as evidenced by restlessness and inconsistency in following commands and answering questions; MAE, PERRL.
RESP: As noted, tachypneic to 30's at start of shift, with excellent sats and ABG's. With mild sedation her RR has been teens with TV's ~400cc's. Sats 98-100%, ABG this AM 7.40/54/107. Suctioned q1-2 hours, initially for thick yellow, now blood-tinged secretions. LS coarse t/o. RSBI 67.
C-V: As noted, pt having bursts of SVT with rate as high as 160's at start of shift, in setting of normal K+,(though ion Ca was 1.09 at the time). BP immediately falling with arrhythmia, but no intervention required, as bursts were self-limiting and brief (a few seconds at the most). Since she's been more comfortable she's had no more SVT. She has required no further K repletion with change in CRRT fluid; Ca gtt titrated per sliding scale. HR initially 90's, now down to 70's, NSR, no VEA. BP stable except transient mild hypotension with sedation. 
GI: Continues to tolerate TF's at goal with minimal residuals. Liquid golden-colored stool via mushroom catheter. Belly benign. LFT's continue to rise, with T bili now up to 46.7.
GU: CRRT restarted at 2130; initially trying to take fluid off, but have been running even since MN d/t bleeding issues. Pt is tolerating therapy with no hypotension and only mild hypothermia. U/O 0-15cc/hr. 
HEME: Pt re-bled from RIJ and LSC line sites; manual pressure applied to both, with new gelfaom/DSD to LSC site, and new absorbable hemostat/pressure dressing to RIJ site. No new bleeding from line sites noted since. In addition, we are suctioning blood with occasional small clots from back of throat, stool is trace OB+, and gastric aspirates are now pink-tinged and OB+. Hct down to 22.3 at 2000; she was given 2 units red cells with repeat Hct 23.5. Another unit to be hung within the next hour. He platelet count initially bumped to 85, but dropped again to 24 this AM; she is currently receiving another unit. She also has recieved cryo, FFP (5 bags), and DDAVP. At present, bleeding seems to have diminished. 
ENDO: Insulin gtt restarted at 2100 after line placement was confirmed by CXR; sugars initially 200's, but have come down to 140'-150's on 7-8u/hr.

Altered mental status continues to be concerning. Bilirubin increasing. Bleeding from line sites and oropharynx.

CNS: Pt. opens eyes when name is called and occasionally follows simple commands. Becomes easily agitated with interventions, not tracking or nodding appropriately. Has not received any sedation, yet propofol has been ordered if needed for comfort. MAE's purposefully. PEARL...3-4mm. 

CVS: Hemodynamically stable with heart rate in the 70's to 80's, NSR without VEA. B/P 110-140/syst. 

F and E: Tolerating CVVHD. Goal has been even fluid balance today and as of 1700 pt. is 300cc negative.  Renal feels she may be converted over to intermittent HD in light of stable cardiac status.  CVP 10-13. 

ID: Briefly hypothermic, placed on bair hugger for 2hr. T current of 98 axillary. Zosyn has been dc'ed. Now on po erythromycin and cipro for GI prophylaxis. 

SKIN: Duoderm over coccyx intact. Generalized edema with oozing of serous fluid from various puncture sites. No new breakdown noted.

GI: Tolerating tube feedings at goal. Continues to receive qid lactulose and has had approximately 600cc of stool today.

ENDO: Please see carevue for q1hr fingersticks and corresponding adjustments in insulin gtt.

RESP: Extubation not attempted due to concern re: ability to protect airway r/t continued alteration in mental status and bleeding from oropharynx. PSV decreased from 15 to 10 with ABG 7.42 47 106 5 32. STV in the mid 300's, RR of 20. Lungs with coarse BS throughout. Suctioned frequently for moderate amounts of thick, yellow secretions. 

HEME: Continued oozing of BRB from right IJ. Pt has received platelets x 1 with rise in platelets from 22K to 44K. Hct of 25.4 post transfusion of PRBC's...drifted down to 24 by 1600. Will transfuse if rebleeds...currently has tapered off.

      no dissection or pulmonary embolus. Focal region of increased attenuation
      within the mesentery which may represent inflammation (mesenteric
      panniculitis), or mesenteric hemorrhage, edema, or tumor (lymphoma) can
      also cause this appearance.  No evidence for compromise of the mesenteric
      vasculature or bowel. A biopsy or repeat CT scan could provide additional
      diagnostic information.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  74-year-old male with hypotension, diaphoresis, bradycardia.
     Please evaluate for aortic dissection, intraabdominal bleed, or pulmonary
     embolus.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT images were obtained through the chest, first
     with a non-contrast low-dose technique, followed by a CT angiogram through the
     chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were
     obtained.
     
     CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is no
     evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolus.  Calcifications are seen
     throughout the visualized aorta, but there is no evidence of aneurysmal
     dilatation.  The lung fields show minimal atelectasis within the bilateral
     lower lung lobes.  There are no focal areas of consolidation or evidence for
     congestive heart failure.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There
     is no pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
     There is fluid within the esophagus.
     
     CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE ABDOMEN:  There is no evidence of aortic dissection within
     the abdominal aorta. The aorta contains atherosclerotic calcifications but
     demonstrates normal caliber throughout. The liver contains multiple low-
     density lesions, the largest of which measures 2.0 x 2.0 cm and is located in
     the posterior aspect of the right lower lobe. Most likely these lesions
     represent simple liver cysts. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal
     glands are normal. The kidneys enhance symmetrically. There is no evidence of
     hydronephrosis or hydroureter. The stomach and intraabdominal loops of small
     and large bowel are unremarkable. There is increased attenuation within the
     mesentery of the mid- to-left abdomen, without evidence for a discrete mass.
     This [**Doctor First Name 39**] mesentery is a nonspecific process that can represent inflammation,
     trauma, edema or tumor (lymphoma).  While this region of increased attenuation
     lays adjacent to the mesenteric vasculature, there is no evidence of
                                                                 (Over)

     vasculature compromise or bowel wall thickening.
     
     CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE PELVIS:  The intrapelvic aortic branches are normal in
     caliber.  The rectum, sigmoid colon, distal ureters, bladder, and prostate
     gland are unremarkable.  The bladder does contain a Foley catheter.  There is
     no pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic, mesenteric or retroperitoneal
     lymphadenopathy.  There is no ascites.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There is extensive degenerative disc disease within the
     visualized thoracolumbar spine, most prominent at the L5-S1 level.  There are
     no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
     
     CT REFORMATS:  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the axial
     findings.  Value grade I.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No evidence for pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
     
     2.  Focal mesenteric region of increased attenuation which most likely
     represents inflammation secondary to mesenteric panniculitis, or less likely
     trauma, edema, or tumor (lymphoma). There is no evidence of mesenteric
     vasculature or bowel compromise.  A biopsy or CT scan in the future may
     provide further diagnostic information.
     
     3.  Fluid within the esophagus which increases this patient's risk of
     aspiration.
     
     4.  Multiple low-attenuation lesions throughout the liver which most likely
     represent simple liver cysts; however, an ultrasound examination could be
     performed for confirmation when the patient is clinically stabilized.

     A single right decubitus view of the chest was obtained, with correlation made
     to chest x-ray performed two hours previously, as well as [**3131-12-11**].
     Multiple lines and tubes are again seen, although they are difficult to
     characterize on this decubitus view. A moderate right-sided pleural effusion
     is seen, with at least partial layering. However, due to the patient's body
     habitus, the degree of layering is difficult to assess.

     PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Compared to previous study of [**3131-12-11**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Lactic acidosis.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
     
     A feeding tube remains in place as well as a right PICC line and bilateral
     internal jugular vascular catheters.  The catheters terminate in the proximal
     right atrium, unchanged.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  There
     is interval improvement in the degree of perihilar haziness and vascular
     engorgement.  However, there is an enlarging right pleural effusion which is
     large in size and could potentially be partially loculated laterally.
     Increased opacity is noted within the right lung adjacent to the pleural
     effusion.  No areas of consolidation are observed in the left lung.  Diffuse
     haziness in the imaged portion of the upper abdomen is suggestive of ascites.
     
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Enlarging right pleural effusion, large in size.  It is difficult to
     exclude loculation laterally.

     hemodialysis catheter has been removed.  The endotracheal tube, the NG line
     and the right IJ central line remain in good positions.  The right PICC line
     tip is in good position in the lower SVC.  The right effusion is again noted,
     not significantly changed since the prior study.  The left lung shows some
     ill-defined patchy pulmonary infiltrates in the lower and mid zones.  This may
     be slightly more marked than on the prior study.  The heart again shows
     moderate left ventricular enlargement.  The pulmonary vessels are difficult to
     evaluate with the patient supine.  Some LV failure cannot be excluded.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Possible slight worsening of LV failure.  Pleural effusion is not
     significantly changed.  The lines remain stable.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Cirrhosis.  Worsening lactic acidosis and ascites.  Status post
     TIPS.
     
     Comparison is made to the previous exam of [**3131-12-2**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The liver is shrunken with nodular contour consistent with
     underlying cirrhosis.  The patient is status post TIPS from the posterior
     branch of the right portal vein.  There is a large right-sided pleural
     effusion.  There is minimal ascites. The patient is status post
     cholecystectomy.  The spleen is enlarged and measures approximately 15 cm in
     long axis.  Both the right and left kidneys are normal in appearance without
     hydronephrosis, mass or stones.  The right kidney measures 10.9 cm, and the
     left kidney measures 11.1 cm.  The pancreas is poorly visualized.  There is no
     biliary ductal dilatation.  The common bile duct measures 3 mm.
     
     Liver Doppler ultrasound:  Color-flow and pulsed wave Doppler analysis of the
     liver was performed.  The study is technically limited due to portable
     examination and the intubated status of the patient.  The main portal vein is
     patent with normal direction of flow.  The main portal vein is at 35 cm per
     second.  A TIPS is identified with wall-to-wall color flow, patency and normal
     direction of flow.  Proximal TIPS is 45 cm per second, mid TIPS roughly 120 cm
     per second, and distal TIPS roughly 150 cm per second.  There is appropriate
     reverse direction of flow in the anterior right portal vein. Evaluation of the
     left portal vein is limited.  The main hepatic and right and left hepatic
     arteries are patent with normal direction of flow.  The hepatic veins are
     limited in evaluation but appear patent.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Patent TIPS with velocities spanning 45 cm per second proximally to roughly
     150 cm per second distally.
     
     2. Cirrhosis with minimal to no ascites seen.  Large right pleural effusion.

     COMPARISONS:  Chest x-ray is performed earlier in the day, as well as
     [**3131-12-11**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The patient has been intubated since the prior AP semierect
     portable chest x-ray performed two hours before.  The tip of the endotracheal
     tube is 3 cm above the carina.  Right-sided PICC is present, with the tip at
     the cavoatrial junction.  In addition, a right-sided IJ central venous
     catheter has been placed, with the tip also at the cavoatrial junction.  Left-
     sided dialysis catheter is present, with the tip terminating at the cavoatrial
     junction.  An enteric tube is present.  A TIPS shunt is seen.
     
     The cardiac silhouette remains stably enlarged.  Right-sided pleural effusion
     is seen, with the difference in positioning compared to the prior examination,
     it does appear that this does at least partially layer.  There is left-sided
     retrocardiac atelectasis versus consolidation.  With comparison to the chest
     x-ray performed [**3131-12-11**], it appears that the right-sided pleural effusion is
     increasing in size.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Lines and tubes in appropriate position.  Slight enlargement of
     right-sided pleural effusion since [**3131-12-11**].

Positive bowel sounds. Tube feeds restarted this evening at 10cc/hr to be advanced slowly to goal 40cc/hr.

GU: UO is excellent via foley.

ID: Continues to have temps today. He was cultured overnight. Tylenol given today once. WBC 7.6 today. Remains on IV Vanco.

Access: New central line inserted because pt had poor access and was going to have the trach/PEG done today. Left subclavian triple lumen line was inserted which he tolerated well. Site was bleeding a lot initially but has stopped and dressing is dry and intact. t also has a-line working well left wrist. He also has two PIV's in place. Plan is to replace central line with PICC line when pt has been afebrile for 48hrs.

Skin: Left elbow has duoderm in place as it was red and excoriated. Collar care done. Pt turned and positioned Q3-4hrs.

Plan: Pt is going to be screened by three rehabs. Case management has given the family a list of these three facilities so they can go see them and if they have a preference. We need to have cantonese interpreter daily to update family as to the plan. they also have a grand-daughter who speaks good English who is involved.

Respiratory Care:
Patient required changing from CPAP/PSV to A/C ventilatory support due to increased WOB, as demonstrated by tachypnea.  ABG results on these new settings revealed a compensated respiratory alkalemia with good oxygenation on the current settings.

RSBI = 137 on 0-PEEP and 5 cm PSV (failed RSBI).

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      74 year old man with ALS, needs hydration.  Patient has already been evaluated 
      by IV team
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      PICC line placement

                                     FINAL REPORT
     PROCEDURE:  5 French dual-lumen PICC line placement via right basilic vein
     approach; ultrasound-guided venipuncture.
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  74-year-old man with ALS, needs IV access for blood draws
     and hydration
     
     OPERATORS:
     1.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 52**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 53**], M.D. (fellow)
     2.  [**Name6 (MD) 54**] [**Name8 (MD) 55**], M.D. (supervising staff)
     
     DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Timeout was performed to identify the patient, the
     procedure to be performed, the site of the procedure, and appropriate
     requisition.  Once the above were verified, the patient was positioned in
     supine fashion on a special procedures/angiography table with the right arm
     abducted, externally rotated, and prepped and draped from the axilla to the
     forearm.  A tourniquet was applied to the upper arm.  Ultrasound was employed
     using usual aseptic precautions for assessment of the venous anatomy of the
     right upper extremity.  The right basilic vein was noted to be widely patent
     and compressible and suitable for venipuncture.  The skin was then infiltrated
     with approximately 3 cc of 1% buffered Xylocaine for local anesthesia.  Under
     ultrasound guidance, uneventful one-wall retrograde venipuncture of the right
     basilic vein was achieved easily.  (Static sonographic images were obtained
     both prior to and after the venipuncture.)  A guidewire was advanced through
     the access needle and delivered to the level of caudal superior vena cava
     using flouroscopic guidance. The intravascular length of the catheter was then
     determined at 40 cm. The catheter was tailored accordingly.  The catheter was
     then delivered using modified Seldinger technique to the caudal superior vena
     cava. Once satisfactory positioning was confirmed, the catheter was secured in
     place at the skin using a StatLock device.  The puncture site and StatLock
     device were overlaid with transparent Tegaderm semi-occlusive dressing.
     Estimated blood loss was minimal.  No immediate complications were
     encountered.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate
     complication.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Status post successful placement of 5 French dual-lumen PICC line
     placement via right basilic vein approach.  Final catheter length is 40 cm.
     Tip position is in caudal superior vena cava.  The catheter is ready to
                                                                 (Over)

     COMPARISON:  Non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2554-8-6**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT contrast-enhanced imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was
     performed following the administration of 150 cc of intravenous Optiray.
     Nonionic contrast was administered per protocol.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH ORAL, WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Staples are seen along the
     coronary arteries, and sternal wires are in place.  When compared with prior
     exam, there has been a significant interval increase in the extent of patchy
     opacification within the right lung base and the size bilateral pleural
     effusions, left greater than right.
     
     Within the abdomen, several tubular air-filled structures are seen within the
     peripheral nondependent left liver lobe.  It is unclear whether this is air
     within the biliary tree, or within the portal venous system.  A 7-mm
     hypodensity within the left liver lobe is unchanged from prior exam.  The
     remainder of the liver parenchyma is unremarkable.  The gallbladder, pancreas,
     spleen, bilateral adrenal glands, and right kidney are normal.  A 2-mm
     hypodensity within the interpolar left kidney is stable and most likely
     represents a tiny cyst.
     
     A large amount of stool is again noted in the colon, but there is no evidence
     of dilatation of large or small bowel loops.  There is no bowel wall
     thickening, or air within the mesenteric vessels.  Diffuse atherosclerotic
     disease is seen throughout the abdominal aorta, and proximal branches.
     
     There is a significant interval decrease in the amount of intra-abdominal
     ascites, and no organized fluid collections or abscesses are identified.
     Surgical clips are seen along the anterior abdominal wall consistent with
     prior and recent surgery.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL, WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The distal ureters,
     sigmoid and rectum are unremarkable.  A Foley catheter is seen within a
     collapsed bladder.  There has been a significant decrease in the amount of
                                                                 (Over)

     1.  No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess.
     2.  Few tubular gas-filled structures within the left liver lobe.  It is
     unclear whether these represent air within the portal venous or biliary
     system.  There is no air within the mesenteric vessels, or loops of intra-
     abdominal large or small bowel.

     performed following the administration of 150 cc of intravenous Optiray.
     Nonionic contrast was administered per protocol.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH ORAL, WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Staples are seen along the
     coronary arteries, and sternal wires are in place.  When compared with prior
     exam, there has been a significant interval increase in the extent of patchy
     opacification within the right lung base and the size bilateral pleural
     effusions, left greater than right.
     
     Within the abdomen, several tubular air-filled structures are seen within the
     peripheral nondependent left liver lobe.  It is unclear whether this is air
     within the biliary tree, or within the portal venous system.  A 7-mm
     hypodensity within the left liver lobe is unchanged from prior exam.  The
     remainder of the liver parenchyma is unremarkable.  The gallbladder, pancreas,
     spleen, bilateral adrenal glands, and right kidney are normal.  A 2-mm
     hypodensity within the interpolar left kidney is stable and most likely
     represents a tiny cyst.
     
     A large amount of stool is again noted in the colon, but there is no evidence
     of dilatation of large or small bowel loops.  There is no bowel wall
     thickening, or air within the mesenteric vessels.  Diffuse atherosclerotic
     disease is seen throughout the abdominal aorta, and proximal branches.
     
     There is a significant interval decrease in the amount of intra-abdominal
     ascites, and no organized fluid collections or abscesses are identified.
     Surgical clips are seen along the anterior abdominal wall consistent with
     prior and recent surgery.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL, WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The distal ureters,
     sigmoid and rectum are unremarkable.  A Foley catheter is seen within a
     collapsed bladder.  There has been a significant decrease in the amount of

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CHEST:
     
     INDICATION:  Hepatic encephalopathy.  Ascites.  Intubated.  Pleural effusion.
     Progressive sepsis and acidosis.  Now has decreasing oxygen saturation and
     vomiting.  Check for interval change.
     
     FINDINGS:  A single AP supine image.
     
     Comparison study dated [**3131-12-14**].  The endotracheal tube, NG line, the right IJ
     central line and the right upper extremity PICC line all remain in good
     position.  The hepatic stent is also again noted, unchanged.  The right sided
     pleural effusion is of moderate size and not significantly changed.  The
     bilateral patchy ill-defined pulmonary infiltrates throughout both lungs
     appear to be increased in intensity and extent since the prior study.  This is
     associated with some bibasilar atelectatic changes.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  There is worsening patchy ill-defined pulmonary infiltrates scattered
     throughout both lungs.  This is presumably due to pulmonary edema vs. patchy
     pneumonitis.  The right pleural effusion is unchanged.  The heart shows slight
     LV enlargement.  Cardiac failure cannot be excluded.  The appearance is
     otherwise unchanged.

NPN 1900-0700:

EVENTS: Overall decline continues with pt is septic shock, MSOF. Se Carevue for details. 

ROS: 
NEURO: Pt responds to stimuli with grimace, MAE without purpose. PERRL. Eyes roving back and forth, not making eye contact or following commands.
RESP: Acidosis resolving, but oxygenation worsening, requiring increase in pO2 to 60%. Current vent settings: AC .6/550/28/5 with most recent ABG 7.40/37/76. Suctioned once for moderate amount thick green-brown secretions. LS CTA upper, diminished lower. CXR shows bilateral white-out.
C-V: HR 80's-90's, NSR with PAC's. Cont's to require Levophed and Vasopressin to support BP. CVP 19-22. K 5.7 in afternoon; pt was given a dose of Kaexolate. Although she vomitted about 2 hours after dose, her repeat K was 4.7. Calcium level remains slightly elevated. Extremities remain warm, well-perfused; pulses difficult to palpate d/t edema.
ID: Normothermic, WBC down a bit to 16. Cont's on multiple abx. All cx pending. 
GU/RENAL: Pt totally anuric with no response to 100mg Lasix. BUN/creat actually down a bit to 78/3.0 (80/3.7). 
GI: Belly obese, hypoactive BS; large amounts liquid golden stool via mushroom catheter. LFT's have [**Hospital Ward Name 471**]-rocketed overnight, indicating fulminant hepatic failure on top of ESLD. As mentioned above, pt vomitted moderate amount brown material once; it was not guiaced, but pt had recieved Kaexolate (which is brown) 2 hours prior. No evidence of aspiration; pt maintained NPO rest of night. Protonix changed to IV, and rest of PO meds held. Pt has pedi-tube which cannot be used for gastric decompression; new NGT not placed d/t risk of bleeding. 
HEME: At 2030, when pt was being suctioned, she coughed, resulting in immediate profuse bleeding from LIJ HD catheter site. Manual pressure applied immediately, achieving hemostasis after 10 minutes. A pressure dressing was then placed for several hours, and has since been removed, leaving original dressing. RIJ CL site later oozed moderate amount BRB; again, manual pressure applied for several minutes, followed by pressure dressing for several hours. This has been replaced with DSD. Pt also has OB+ stool, bleeding gums, and often bleeds for several minutes from FSBS sites. She was given 2U FFP after LIJ site bled; INR before and after the same, at 2.2; plts dropped from 98 to 56, and she was given 1 bag. Hct dropped to 22.8 (26.5) and she was given 1 unit PRBC's. Fibrinogen fairly stable at 125. 
ENDO: Initially required significant increase in insulin gtt to max of 12u/hr; eventually her sugar fell rapidly to low of 61, and currently gtt is off. 
SKIN: Coccyx decub looks worse than when I last saw it 4 days ago; new Duoderm applied; DSD on left wrist intact; myconazole powder to groin. 
SOCIAL: no calls/visits; see MD [**First Name (Titles) 14**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] notes for details of interactions yesterday.

A: MSOF with very poor prognosis

74 yo male admitted to MICU for hypercarbia and BIPAP.

PMH includes spinal stenosis - s/p cervical laminectomy C 3,4,5 and fusion, neurogenic bladder with chronic foley cath, BPH, HTN

Pt was discharged from [**Hospital1 2**] after lami to rehab on [**8-13**].  He was doing well until 3 days prior to admission when he had trouble sleeping and started feeling lightheaded.  Pt has had considerable pain and requiring large doses of pain med for relief.  Upper extremities have become weaker and patient is unable to lift arms off of the bed.  Upon admission to ED - pt found to have temp to 101.6, HTN, CXR showed RLL and RML atelectasis or PNA.  Transferred to MICU for further treatment and evaluation.

CV - Pt afebrile throughout shift.  BP stable but HR 80's when resting to 112-120 when nervous or agitated.  IVF at KVO but fluid bolus given when UO dropped and HR down to the 80's again.  At 0510 pt had an episode of ? SVT to rate of 150 - while trying to get an EKG - pt spontaneously broke to regular rhythm.  MICU team aware.

Resp - BS very diminished to right lung and cl to LUL but decreased to LLL.  O2 at 2L NC.

GI - Abd soft with positive BS.  Tolerating sips of water with meds.

GU - Foley cath draining adequate amt cl yellow urine.  Pt's HR started to increase and UO decreased so bolus given with positive results.

Neuro - Pt is primarily chinese speaking but does understand and is able to speak some english.  He can move all extremities but is very weak.  He is alert and oriented to person and place.  He is extremely tired (has not slept in over 3 days) and just wants to [**Doctor Last Name 65**].

Social - Wife, daughter, son and granddaughter in to see patient.  Chinese interpreter called and all information was given to the family via the interpreter.  They are comfortable with his plan of care.  They did go home to get some [**Doctor Last Name 65**] and would like to be called for any changes.

Nsg Addendum 

At approx 5:40 am - ABG results showed elevated CO2 of 94.  Decision made to try pt on BIPAP.  Once mask applied - pt became very somnolent and breathing decreased dramatically.  When encouraged to breath, pt was difficult to arouse.   Narcan given x2 for total of .8mg IVP with minimal response.  Anesthesia called to see patient for intubation and while waiting, respiratory  began ambuing pt to increase ventilation - pt quickly woke up much more and attempted to move mask from face.  Placed pt back on 2L NC - but pt became somnolent again and RR decreased.  Anesthesia was able to intubate pt fiberoptically and pt is now vented with positive BS bilat.
BP during intubation procedure was very labile and required multiple doses of ephedrine.  BP continues to be labile post intubation - pt receiving fluid bolus with good response.
Family notified of events of the morning and the information has been passed on to other family members.  Some family members plan to come in this morning and a chinese interpreter will be needed and has been requested.

     retracted somewhat, now approximately 6.6 cm above the carina.  A left lower
     lobe opacity has improved, with better aeration.  There is a stable right
     lower lobe opacity which shows both linear and nodular components.  In
     addition, there is slightly hazy asymmetric opacity involving the right
     hemithorax compared to the left.  This appearance is also unchanged.  Apical
     capping bilaterally is noted, perhaps due to effusions.  There is no
     pneumothorax.
